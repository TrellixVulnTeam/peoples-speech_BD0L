thanks edwin .

12
00:01:22,290 --> 00:01:34,376
okay , is there anything else that corporation council

13
00:01:33,380 --> 00:01:37,630
when do you do that
now .

14
00:01:37,441 --> 00:01:38,691
okay .

15
00:01:38,790 --> 00:01:40,040
thank you chair .

16
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:44,500
welcome , sir kennison , sir lundberg , apologize
for not being here last month .

17
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:46,750
i gave you guys a packet a little while ago .

18
00:01:46,910 --> 00:01:49,905
theres a few little handouts in there .

19
00:01:49,905 --> 00:01:53,750
the first one , new board of commission member
orientation . . .

20
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:58,280
oh sorry , if any of the other members want another packet
i can get you one i just dont carry them with me .

21
00:01:58,280 --> 00:02:02,406
so let jill know and she can let me know .

22
00:02:02,406 --> 00:02:08,585
so , if you just want to go over this ,
the new member and new board and commission
member orientation packet .

23
00:02:08,585 --> 00:02:12,335
just kind of goes over some generally ,
general frequently asked questions .

24
00:02:12,810 --> 00:02:18,305
if you have any questions feel free
to contact myself or jill and jill can get
in touch with me .

25
00:02:18,305 --> 00:02:21,305
the next bigger one is a guide to the sunshine law .

26
00:02:21,745 --> 00:02:25,485
its produced by the state of hawaii
office of information practices .

27
00:02:25,485 --> 00:02:28,235
theres a lot of details in the sunshine law .

28
00:02:28,340 --> 00:02:34,090
so , in my presentations i generally dont get
into hypotheticals of , if this , then that , you know .

29
00:02:33,875 --> 00:02:39,875
its more as topics come up im typically
at these meetings so please ask if you have any questions .

30
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:52,360
generally speaking , i request that
its a self policing policy so all i ask
is try not to talk about board business
with other board members outside of board meetings .

31
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:56,110
you can talk about stuff with members of the public
not board members .

32
00:02:56,235 --> 00:02:58,485
anybody can talk about board business with it .

33
00:02:58,700 --> 00:03:04,950
but between board members we ask that all
those communications happen in a meeting ,
down to emails and everything .

34
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:12,450
if youre gonna have to email the group
please run it through board secretary and please do not
reply to those emails to the whole group .

35
00:03:12,450 --> 00:03:16,090
they will just be collected by the board secretary .

36
00:03:16,090 --> 00:03:22,590
theres other intricate things , i believe theres discussion
to go into a sub committees and all that .

37
00:03:22,905 --> 00:03:26,655
when the matters come up well go into that
in more detail at that time .

38
00:03:26,525 --> 00:03:33,860
but generally speaking please keep board business
discussions at board meetings between board members .

39
00:03:33,860 --> 00:03:40,360
the next packet is , its a article , or you know ,
im not sure what you want to call it .

40
00:03:40,573 --> 00:03:43,320
but its written by professor van dyke .

41
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:44,450
its kind of a breakdown .

42
00:03:44,157 --> 00:03:46,907
its a different way to read the sunshine law .

43
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:51,255
its kinda dated at this point
but the information still holds true .

44
00:03:51,255 --> 00:03:58,242
the next one is the chapter two point five six ,
maui county code of ethics .

45
00:03:58,242 --> 00:04:03,045
if you have any questions on that please let us know .

46
00:04:03,045 --> 00:04:06,813
the next one is article ten
of the charter the code of ethics .

47
00:04:06,813 --> 00:04:14,086
again , if you have any questions on that
please let us know but essentially
theres a few prohibitions .

48
00:04:14,086 --> 00:04:21,195
to me , it comes down to more , you guys
are all professionals , very well respected people
in the community .

49
00:04:21,195 --> 00:04:26,340
try not to do things that are conflicts of interest
or improper .

50
00:04:26,340 --> 00:04:34,065
and if you do believe you have a conflict of interest
or something in the code of ethics , theres a question .

51
00:04:34,065 --> 00:04:38,250
well probably refer you to try and get an
advisor opinion from the board of ethics .

52
00:04:38,250 --> 00:04:41,630
so thats my presentation in a nutshell .

53
00:04:41,630 --> 00:04:47,165
i know both of you gentlemen have been
on many commissions before but if you have
any questions . . .

54
00:04:47,165 --> 00:04:49,335
thank your chair .

55
00:04:49,335 --> 00:04:52,094
yeah , i dont know whos chair right now but . .

56
00:04:52,094 --> 00:04:57,094
just like , i know both of you guys have been on
many commissions before so you kinda know the drill .

57
00:04:57,650 --> 00:05:01,095
our chair has arrived so i am relieved .

58
00:05:01,095 --> 00:05:04,595
thank you vice chair , youre on time .

59
00:05:05,030 --> 00:05:10,566
so lets move on to item number six ,
my emergency management .

60
00:05:10,566 --> 00:05:14,316
hi , good morning so you have in front
of you our monthly report .

61
00:05:14,690 --> 00:05:27,690
just a few items , we had received our staff specialist
three list and we actually were able to conduct interviews
yesterday and were hoping to make an offer
to one of the candidates that we interviewed
for that position .

62
00:05:27,536 --> 00:05:31,786
so , well be full staff if that person takes
the position .

63
00:05:32,140 --> 00:05:42,980
as far as training and exercises we finished our eoc
basic training for our partners so that was over
about a five week period where they were coming
in on mondays to do that and now were moving on

64
00:05:42,980 --> 00:05:46,980
into hurricane preparedness for community things .

65
00:05:45,620 --> 00:05:59,730
there was a zika tabletop exercise
which seems a little bit odd because the focus
has kind of moved away from zika but as were getting
into the season again where mosquitoes and high travel
we had that particular exercise .

66
00:05:59,730 --> 00:06:04,230
on the preparedness side our harp program
is continuing in west maui .

67
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:07,670
theyve been very successful in terms of good turnout .

68
00:06:07,670 --> 00:06:09,570
weve had a lot of repeat personnel .

69
00:06:09,570 --> 00:06:17,070
we werent sure if the people would come to each meeting
every month but weve seen a steady participation in that .

70
00:06:17,330 --> 00:06:22,905
and after this month , which is tropical cyclone ,
they move away from hazard awareness
into actual planning .

71
00:06:22,905 --> 00:06:28,850
so well see how many people start to come out
for the planning piece of it , which is more
pencil to the paper kind of stuff .

72
00:06:28,850 --> 00:06:31,100
ill just move down to the response piece .

73
00:06:31,770 --> 00:06:34,295
the emergent . . .

74
00:06:34,295 --> 00:06:40,199
event , i guess well call it ,
that weve been involved in is the
rat lung worm disease .

75
00:06:40,199 --> 00:06:46,479
a lot of times people forget that we also
are participating with the department of health
during those types of events .

76
00:06:46,479 --> 00:06:52,540
so really were just . . . were not the lead on that ,
department of health always remains the lead on that .

77
00:06:52,540 --> 00:06:59,088
but we continue to support in terms of coordination
and especially with their messaging piece of it .

78
00:06:59,088 --> 00:07:11,407
if you have any questions on the report
im happy to take those otherwise ill move
into the piece that commissioner john kyle
asked about last week , or last month
with the activation levels .

79
00:07:11,907 --> 00:07:16,907
questions
okay .

80
00:07:17,380 --> 00:07:19,130
you have two handouts in front of you .

81
00:07:19,410 --> 00:07:24,410
the first one , nice bright color coded one
is our eoc activation levels .

82
00:07:24,570 --> 00:07:31,320
we used to just have three but then fema
and the national incident management system
had recommended a four tier .

83
00:07:31,940 --> 00:07:34,690
which was very much similar to what we had .

84
00:07:34,935 --> 00:07:38,255
we just didnt have our day to day operations
on there which is level four .

85
00:07:38,255 --> 00:07:43,505
so you can see it starts at level four ,
normal operations steady state so thats today .

86
00:07:43,690 --> 00:07:45,690
its blue because we call it blue sky day .

87
00:07:45,750 --> 00:07:47,750
you know , its just a nice day .

88
00:07:48,260 --> 00:07:51,760
were always monitoring for things that might happen
with a no notice event .

89
00:07:51,975 --> 00:07:55,087
so the eoc is not staffed at that time .

90
00:07:55,087 --> 00:08:04,448
the number three enhanced steady state
is something has come up that maybe requires us
to pay attention to it a little bit more .

91
00:08:04,448 --> 00:08:18,698
we dont have the eoc staffed really at that point ,
but our standby person who is on call or on standby
throughout the evening hours and off hours
is monitoring that actively , looking at notifications

92
00:08:18,820 --> 00:08:21,325
from the weather service or whatever event it might be .

93
00:08:21,325 --> 00:08:23,575
a level two is a partial activation .

94
00:08:23,925 --> 00:08:26,715
thats the most common thing that we have
after a level three .

95
00:08:26,715 --> 00:08:28,465
thats when we have some of our partners in .

96
00:08:28,935 --> 00:08:35,100
it maybe is a event thats focused
on a specific geographic area ,
its not island or county wide .

97
00:08:35,100 --> 00:08:42,365
so well have the emergency support functions
in who would be affected by that particular event .

98
00:08:42,365 --> 00:08:46,121
and then a level one activation is a full activation .

99
00:08:46,121 --> 00:08:50,121
we have all of our county partners and state
and other partners in .

100
00:08:50,486 --> 00:08:55,375
staffing all of the emergency support functions
in anticipation of something that we know is coming .

101
00:08:55,375 --> 00:09:06,383
or its happening or occurring as we are speaking
and the response and recoverys going to require
additional resources than just one or two
particular agencies .

102
00:09:06,383 --> 00:09:11,878
the next page i just made a quick kind of at a glance .

103
00:09:11,878 --> 00:09:17,510
there are some events that automatically
trigger a certain activation level .

104
00:09:17,510 --> 00:09:19,195
and thats what you see on that chart there .

105
00:09:19,195 --> 00:09:25,033
so with a tropical cyclone when the forecast
or advisories are issued again we see that coming .

106
00:09:25,033 --> 00:09:33,143
so it starts out with just our staff
and maybe weve made a notification for people who have
something in their day to day operations
that they would do .

107
00:09:33,143 --> 00:09:39,526
then as it escalates from watch to warning
youll see that activation level then scales up
to a two and a one .

108
00:09:39,526 --> 00:09:43,426
the one that is most . . .

109
00:09:43,426 --> 00:09:45,800
ill say difficult to . . .

110
00:09:46,030 --> 00:09:48,030
maybe difficults not the right word .

111
00:09:48,170 --> 00:09:57,355
the one thats the most fluid probably
is a flood scenario because a flood watch will come out
and itll be maybe county wide
and so we know theres potential for heavy rains etcetera .

112
00:09:57,355 --> 00:10:04,765
and then when they issue an advisory ,
that means that heavy rains are occurring
in a certain area and flooding may be imminent .

113
00:10:04,765 --> 00:10:09,515
but then when it goes to a warning level
its more than just nuisance flooding .

114
00:10:09,490 --> 00:10:11,740
so the advisory is what they call nuisance flooding .

115
00:10:11,810 --> 00:10:15,810
so there will be flooding and ponding on the roads ,
but its not getting into peoples homes .

116
00:10:16,030 --> 00:10:21,145
its not endangering life so much as
it is maybe properties , but not at a higher level .

117
00:10:21,145 --> 00:10:25,640
so when we go to a warning our staff automatically
goes into the eoc .

118
00:10:26,010 --> 00:10:32,510
because during a warning for a flood it goes
from nothing to something pretty quickly .

119
00:10:32,510 --> 00:10:35,590
so again weve already been in contact with our partners .

120
00:10:35,590 --> 00:10:37,517
they obviously know its raining outside .

121
00:10:37,517 --> 00:10:52,520
but as were monitoring the situation and just
in contact with our partners , that call of when to ,
for the standby eoc person , to call the other partners
is a judgment call ill say .

122
00:10:51,723 --> 00:11:01,230
and thats the one i think that is the most fluid
as far as , warning doesnt automatically bring
in the other partners .

123
00:11:01,230 --> 00:11:10,955
and then things that are a no notice event
like an earthquake or a mass casualty ,
they happen when they happen and then thats an automatic
eoc activation level .

124
00:11:10,955 --> 00:11:16,740
charles , did that answer your question
yes , it answers a lot of questions but i still
have a few questions .

125
00:11:16,740 --> 00:11:17,605
sure .

126
00:11:17,605 --> 00:11:26,355
now as far as districts and notification and actions
they take , lanai , molokai , lahaina .

127
00:11:27,220 --> 00:11:40,970
now at what point do you recommend that they take action
or measures to prepare for a storm
so those are the same as what we do here on this island

128
00:11:41,220 --> 00:11:43,470
so its a county wide notification .

129
00:11:43,630 --> 00:11:49,700
its the other ones like the flood ,
again that its happening strictly in a specific district .

130
00:11:49,700 --> 00:11:56,660
those are the ones that are a little bit more
challenging for us but i would recommend similar
to what we have here .

131
00:11:56,660 --> 00:12:02,160
and i can talk , we still havent been able
to hire our part time person in those districts .

132
00:12:02,670 --> 00:12:10,170
but that person would be the one that would staff
and activate , either by themself or with partners ,
in those eocs .

133
00:12:10,850 --> 00:12:21,220
okay , well i guess what im looking at is lets say
a storm is coming in and theres certain measures
that district supervisors for the public works
can take .

134
00:12:21,220 --> 00:12:33,470
so i guess , whats the trigger point for their
activation or recommendation from you to the public
works to start preparing
so those would usually start happening

135
00:12:33,805 --> 00:12:41,305
at a watch level and those at the eoc were not ,
were recommending for the departments to activate
their own plan .

136
00:12:41,593 --> 00:12:45,031
so public works has their own triggers for that
and they match up with ours .

137
00:12:45,031 --> 00:12:51,716
so when we call a watch , thats why too were always
in consultation with the weather service when theyre
gonna make that call .

138
00:12:51,716 --> 00:12:58,018
because it does trigger actions in departmental
emergency plans .

139
00:12:58,018 --> 00:13:11,768
is there a standard as far as measures that can
be taken once they get a trigger point
for example , you know of course molokai , for example ,

140
00:13:12,157 --> 00:13:19,147
steven arcy used to start filling up his trucks ,
start staging them in critical areas .

141
00:13:19,147 --> 00:13:22,897
is there a standard that you know that the
public works takes
yeah , same thing .

142
00:13:23,246 --> 00:13:23,496
okay .

143
00:13:23,563 --> 00:13:29,313
both for tsunami and tropical cyclones , a watch
triggers actions by each of those departments .

144
00:13:30,095 --> 00:13:44,845
and is it basically a standard plan or every
district supervisor has their own plan
and are others aware of that plan
its a standard plan department wide so
public works has their plan when we go

145
00:13:45,030 --> 00:13:46,900
into one of these levels .

146
00:13:46,900 --> 00:13:53,510
i cant speak to their personnel as far as how well
they know their internal plan .

147
00:13:53,510 --> 00:14:08,510
my next question would be , as far as the
utility companies , that are very important ,
whats your dialogue with them as far as
their notifications
cause they can take the same precautionary measures too

148
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:14,772
that they , you know , theres points where water departments ,
theyll shut down , you know , theyll lock down .

149
00:14:14,772 --> 00:14:25,022
as far as dialogue with them where are you
or when does that happen
sure , so the way we have the eoc staffed now ,
in our operations section we have three branches .

150
00:14:25,300 --> 00:14:27,300
and one of the branches is infrastructure .

151
00:14:27,450 --> 00:14:33,200
and the meco department of water supply with the county ,
the telephone company .

152
00:14:33,417 --> 00:14:38,062
so , our public and private utilities are part
of infrastructure branch .

153
00:14:38,062 --> 00:14:40,557
so theyre called in and theyre on our call list .

154
00:14:40,557 --> 00:14:42,057
okay , they are
yup , theyre part of our . . .

155
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:47,206
all the water departments , all the private guys
they all come in
no , not all the private water guys come in .

156
00:14:47,207 --> 00:14:55,957
they have a liaison because we dont have that much room
so when we notify them they notify
i know theres some partnerships like maui
yes , yes .

157
00:14:55,498 --> 00:15:01,864
okay , so they have a representative that attends
something
they have one that represents private water , yes .

158
00:15:01,864 --> 00:15:03,164
thank you .

159
00:15:03,164 --> 00:15:03,664
youre welcome .

160
00:15:03,690 --> 00:15:09,980
travis , would you be interested in that part time
position
i know , keep your eyes out when it comes open .

161
00:15:09,980 --> 00:15:15,083
i had a question , it goes back
to the rat lung worm disease .

162
00:15:15,041 --> 00:15:15,541
oh , ah huh .

163
00:15:15,436 --> 00:15:30,936
is there a known hot spot of the origin
of the disease itself
here on maui or in general
in general , is there a place where the rats
have the disease and thats why its coming out
of that area
or do they know

164
00:15:30,860 --> 00:15:37,185
not that im aware of , i mean , here its been
weve been seeing it obviously in east maui but . . .

165
00:15:37,185 --> 00:15:47,005
i know on the big island it was linked to a cow heart
and a slug in there right
well that was just that particular incident but
theyve had rat lung worm on the big island
for a long time already .

166
00:15:47,005 --> 00:15:55,470
and i think when they started to do some more research
theres been individual instances on the other ,
in the other counties as well .

167
00:15:55,470 --> 00:16:02,172
but the key for us again is cause weve seen
a little bit of panic with that particular disease .

168
00:16:02,172 --> 00:16:09,117
where people are not buying local produce and we
just want to stress that its not that you cannot
buy the local produce .

169
00:16:09,117 --> 00:16:10,965
it comes down to the consumers .

170
00:16:10,965 --> 00:16:17,265
the farmers are doing what they can and then the
intermediary is doing what they can to make sure
that its clean and safe .

171
00:16:17,265 --> 00:16:21,015
but as a consumer its up to us also to make sure
that were washing it .

172
00:16:21,230 --> 00:16:23,480
and thats all it takes is washing it properly .

173
00:16:23,830 --> 00:16:28,080
it doesnt even take you know those special things
that theyre selling at the store , those sprays
and things like that .

174
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:34,674
if you take the time and wash your produce
and its not just , we should tell folks ,
all produce .

175
00:16:34,674 --> 00:16:39,036
and so thats kind of the slogan that were
working on is wash all produce all the time .

176
00:16:39,036 --> 00:16:44,603
even if it says pre washed , even if its
from the mainland , cause they have other things
in their produce too sometimes .

177
00:16:44,603 --> 00:16:52,165
so its just a habit that we need to retrain ourselves on
as a community is wash all produce all the time .

178
00:16:52,165 --> 00:16:58,165
any more questions
thank you ann .

179
00:16:57,286 --> 00:17:00,241
thank you .

180
00:17:00,241 --> 00:17:08,133
let us now move on to item number seven ,
fire department .

181
00:17:08,133 --> 00:17:19,811
aloha , good morning members before you
you have our monthly highlights for the month of april .

182
00:17:19,811 --> 00:17:30,941
okay , does your team need any questions
as before we move forward
but at any point in time as we go through each item
you are welcome to ask questions .

183
00:17:30,941 --> 00:17:40,521
all right item 7a the department highlights
for motions and interviews .

184
00:17:40,521 --> 00:17:46,105
if you see there we have gone through the process
of going through our recruit trainees .

185
00:17:46,105 --> 00:17:52,860
we did a performance agility tests at the
end of march .

186
00:17:53,382 --> 00:17:55,882
and we qualified some people for our openings
that we have .

187
00:17:56,150 --> 00:18:03,648
we currently have seventeen openings and we
will be starting that class july first of this year .

188
00:18:04,677 --> 00:18:13,427
we wanted to do it in march , excuse me , in may
but we did not have the funding to move forward ,
so it moves us back .

189
00:18:13,970 --> 00:18:21,743
the average recruit class lasts six and a half months
so that pushes us into january of two thousand and eighteen .

190
00:18:21,743 --> 00:18:28,146
our projected retirements are twenty for this year .

191
00:18:28,146 --> 00:18:33,146
we had five thus far so we anticipate fifteen more .

192
00:18:33,300 --> 00:18:38,400
so that might cause us a shortage issue of going
towards the end of the year .

193
00:18:38,406 --> 00:18:43,406
and thats something that we try to have discussions
with council and the mayors office .

194
00:18:43,406 --> 00:18:45,906
chief
yes .

195
00:18:46,843 --> 00:19:00,850
would you describe a little bit more about what
you said when you didnt have the funds
okay
you had to delay the training class
because you didnt have funds
yes , so our department ran into a shortage

196
00:19:00,850 --> 00:19:15,850
somewhere around november of two thousand and sixteen and
as we move forward to move around funding
from different programs to make it ,
project it til june 30th we came with a short fall

197
00:19:16,008 --> 00:19:25,803
of one point two million moving forward in payroll
and what have you .

198
00:19:25,803 --> 00:19:35,765
so in those areas we utilized overtime for our training
instructors to come in and help with the process
of the recruit class .

199
00:19:35,765 --> 00:19:46,420
and so that was an issue and a topic
and we did not have the funding to pay
for the recruits during this fiscal year .

200
00:19:46,420 --> 00:19:54,170
so thats where the shortages are
and have you thought about going back
to county council asking for a special assessment
we did , and . . .

201
00:19:54,280 --> 00:19:55,280
sorry for pulling you into this .

202
00:19:55,470 --> 00:20:07,290
no , so we provided the information for them
and no money was added to our budget
for this fiscal year to handle it .

203
00:20:07,290 --> 00:20:10,040
but there was a lengthy discussion about it .

204
00:20:10,270 --> 00:20:14,231
your a million and a half short
roughly .

205
00:20:14,231 --> 00:20:20,846
and what will that grow by the end of the fiscal year
hopefully not by much .

206
00:20:20,846 --> 00:20:28,980
we ask for a budget amendment to move forward
to the 30th to handle all of those payroll issues .

207
00:20:28,980 --> 00:20:41,265
and we had the amendment , i believe its
in second reading , if im not mistaken , for next week
and hopefully we get that and nothing drastic happens
between now and june 30th .

208
00:20:41,265 --> 00:20:45,820
but this is our fifth year that weve gone in
for a budget amendment .

209
00:20:45,820 --> 00:20:57,070
let me guess , the first four didnt get it
theres a question i was gonna ask you
so the first four every year thus far ,
this is our fifth year that weve gone
in for a budget amendment .

210
00:20:57,196 --> 00:20:57,462
every year
yeah .

211
00:20:57,260 --> 00:20:59,820
every year weve gotten a budget amendment
for the shortage .

212
00:21:01,210 --> 00:21:04,710
thank you chief .

213
00:21:04,670 --> 00:21:06,165
youre welcome .

214
00:21:05,630 --> 00:21:08,894
you said every year you had a new budget .

215
00:21:08,894 --> 00:21:14,974
every year , so its ranged
from eighty thousand dollars to two million dollars .

216
00:21:14,974 --> 00:21:28,531
so , as we present our budget those are the
things that go into the process from the mayors office
and then it gets cut during the budget deliberations
with council .

217
00:21:28,531 --> 00:21:40,726
so a lot of our projections are pretty close
to what we need but then the cuts are made and we have
to go back through this process over and over again .

218
00:21:40,726 --> 00:21:47,213
im curious who do you submit the request to
the chair , budget chair
yes .

219
00:21:47,213 --> 00:21:58,940
so the process goes through a transmittal form
which goes from us to the mayors office
to budget , from budget to the chair of the council
and then from the budget , i mean from the council chair
to the budget chair .

220
00:21:58,940 --> 00:22:04,007
and then theyll either schedule it or not .

221
00:22:04,007 --> 00:22:10,510
thank you
youre welcome
next question here .

222
00:22:10,560 --> 00:22:11,306
sure .

223
00:22:11,370 --> 00:22:22,370
chief , you know when you do have recruitment
for classes how is it advertised
it is online as well as in the maui news
and i believe the star advertiser .

224
00:22:22,310 --> 00:22:27,080
but it doesnt go into the molokai district
i cant answer that question .

225
00:22:27,080 --> 00:22:31,330
you cant answer me cause thats how molokai people
dont know when the recruitments happen .

226
00:22:31,188 --> 00:22:31,438
yeah .

227
00:22:31,860 --> 00:22:35,060
that comes out of our personal department but i can
pass that information on .

228
00:22:38,360 --> 00:22:46,799
can we get that advertisement too as commissioner
notifications
yeah .

229
00:22:46,799 --> 00:22:59,016
it kind of doesnt necessarily go through
the fire department , the department of personnel
services handles that so you can ask for a quest
but its not something handled internally by
the department .

230
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:03,282
but ill ask .

231
00:23:03,282 --> 00:23:10,107
cause i mean , i think that would be an effective
way to get more molokai people to apply because they
just dont know about it .

232
00:23:10,107 --> 00:23:15,068
i wonder if our personnel services
has a notification list .

233
00:23:14,739 --> 00:23:16,489
they do .

234
00:23:16,525 --> 00:23:27,640
so you just put your name on it and
so now they have it electronically so an individual
can go on , even if theyre not looking for anybody ,
provide their information on that list and then

235
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:40,890
when they do send the list out on the first mail out
of the newspaper then it would come to them
on the following monday , so usually goes out on a sunday
and on a monday theyll get an email blast .

236
00:23:41,170 --> 00:23:44,530
as long as their email address information is correct .

237
00:23:44,550 --> 00:23:46,434
and updated .

238
00:23:46,434 --> 00:23:54,180
i guess you can let the newspapers of molokai know that ,
have people just sign up or it .

239
00:23:54,130 --> 00:24:00,290
thats a good idea , it should pay for itself though man .

240
00:24:00,290 --> 00:24:04,180
itd sure alleviate the non employment issue .

241
00:24:04,180 --> 00:24:09,883
so based on that information or that request
i will send that information to department
of personnel services .

242
00:24:09,883 --> 00:24:11,768
thank you .

243
00:24:11,768 --> 00:24:20,078
members , id like to welcome miss cher betas
to the meeting .

244
00:24:20,078 --> 00:24:35,097
im sorry , all right so moving from seven , item 7d
on number of incident reports , if we can look
in your handouts for the month of april .

245
00:24:35,097 --> 00:24:54,925
and do you have any questions
no questions

246
00:24:54,925 --> 00:25:05,170
i just noticed that what do you call false alarms
stays pretty consistent the amount yeah
sure does .

247
00:25:05,250 --> 00:25:09,000
yeah .

248
00:25:11,580 --> 00:25:24,031
any questions members
just one question about this false alarms ,
are they from alarm companies or are they from
people actually pulling alarms
its a mix of both .

249
00:25:24,031 --> 00:25:39,115
i believe i spoke , im not sure if it was last month
or the month before but anytime we have the
alarm companies issue we go and if its more than
three times we send them a letter .

250
00:25:39,115 --> 00:25:43,708
they usually get on them pretty quick .

251
00:25:43,708 --> 00:25:57,958
is there anybody youre actually tracking ,
whose constant repeat . false alarm goes to the car
fire and hazard
we have one that is separate , ours passed before
the police false alarm bill .

252
00:25:58,601 --> 00:26:09,985
so we have a process that we can use to go
after those individuals or companies
that have false alarms .

253
00:26:09,985 --> 00:26:19,826
i mean anything that you know you can do
to reduce you know this cry wolf syndrome .

254
00:26:19,826 --> 00:26:25,071
and a lot of times when we get a rash of this
its due to bad weather .

255
00:26:25,071 --> 00:26:28,071
so electronically things dont run properly .

256
00:26:28,430 --> 00:26:35,627
thats when youll see the influx and it doesnt
just happen to us but police department , civil events
and emergency management .

257
00:26:35,627 --> 00:26:40,858
the big problem i noticed when i was working
was alarms werent being serviced .

258
00:26:40,679 --> 00:26:41,429
right .

259
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:54,723
and the batteries werent being replaced and when
there was a power outage youre supposed to switch
to that battery thats backed up but if the batteries
dead it triggers the alarm .

260
00:26:54,723 --> 00:27:05,490
so i think , but they really need , somebody really
needs to look at ensuring that alarm companies
service these alarms on a regular basis to prevent this

261
00:27:05,490 --> 00:27:09,490
excessive response to false alarms .

262
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:24,664
for the most part we have in excess of six thousand
commercial properties and all of those have fire
alarms so if were talking fifty out of those six thousand
that we know of i think the ratio is really good
considering .

263
00:27:24,664 --> 00:27:35,040
we do anything excessive we do reach out through
our fire prevention bureau and through our
inspection process that is on the checklist
at all times .

264
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:43,040
so it is looked at on a daily basis throughout
our community , hopefully that helps .

265
00:27:43,032 --> 00:27:43,827
thank you .

266
00:27:43,827 --> 00:27:45,327
youre welcome .

267
00:27:45,700 --> 00:27:49,450
chief , you made a question on the alarms .

268
00:27:49,470 --> 00:27:59,223
do all these commercial properties , like multiples ,
or quick malls and all , do they all have lock boxes
or do you know . . .

269
00:28:00,140 --> 00:28:05,945
it is a requirement from us , is if they start off
new we require them to do the lock box .

270
00:28:05,945 --> 00:28:08,020
and so majority of them have that .

271
00:28:08,020 --> 00:28:19,493
we try not to use that as a lesson
so yeah thats available to us .

272
00:28:19,493 --> 00:28:33,396
any more questions
okay so item 7c fire department two thousand fiscal year two thousand and eighteen
budget updates .

273
00:28:33,396 --> 00:28:48,896
which of the three
all right so out of our eighty three items
that we put forward through the mayors office

274
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:52,000
only four of those items made it through to council .

275
00:28:52,577 --> 00:28:56,561
and then im gonna talk a little bit about
some of the cuts .

276
00:28:56,561 --> 00:29:09,311
all right so , you know county wide funding
where they try to put most of the equipment in .

277
00:29:09,930 --> 00:29:15,495
so we go along with department of public works
and environmental management they put it in .

278
00:29:15,495 --> 00:29:30,890
that fund for our ladder truck that cut four hundred thousand dollars
so from one point two million to , i believe it was
eight hundred so that doesnt get us a sufficient ladder truck

279
00:29:30,890 --> 00:29:35,565
but were in the process of putting that out to bid
and see where it ends up .

280
00:29:35,565 --> 00:29:44,700
and then maybe going back to ask for a amendment
for the bid that comes in , the winning bid .

281
00:29:43,950 --> 00:29:46,700
i have a question chief .

282
00:29:46,768 --> 00:29:47,018
sure .

283
00:29:47,166 --> 00:29:59,691
you know when they make these cuts
do they consult with you guys experts on their decision ,
why theyre making the cuts when you guys know
that something that you need
smart .

284
00:29:59,691 --> 00:30:01,190
thank you for that question .

285
00:30:01,060 --> 00:30:04,901
that is a really good question , the answer is no .

286
00:30:04,901 --> 00:30:19,150
i know they try to do research with other departments
within hawaii of what one of the measuring points
that they have to really consider is specifications
what are the differences and what are different needs

287
00:30:18,990 --> 00:30:22,090
of the other counties as opposed to ours .

288
00:30:22,090 --> 00:30:37,090
were pretty clear on what our needs are
and im not sure what the whole process
about their decisions are but this is not the first time
that thats happened so it really puts the damper

289
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:43,170
on the whole process and the whole timing
of the contracts when they actually go out .

290
00:30:43,170 --> 00:30:46,560
so thank you for that question .

291
00:30:46,560 --> 00:30:59,475
so the good news is the two battalion chiefs
that this commission as well as our administration
has been fighting for has been put on
for a limited term .

292
00:30:59,475 --> 00:31:05,595
so what that means is we were able to hire
the two people but theyll be limited not permanent .

293
00:31:05,595 --> 00:31:19,095
and the findings of an audit that they also approved
that council will pay for whatever that findings
come out will either make those positions permanent
or eliminate them completely .

294
00:31:19,420 --> 00:31:21,700
so im not sure how that process is gonna work .

295
00:31:21,700 --> 00:31:29,135
im still waiting on the information for that
but our department will be full cooperation
with that audit .

296
00:31:29,135 --> 00:31:37,135
one of the suggestions we had was that the accreditation
is a full blown audit of the department .

297
00:31:37,725 --> 00:31:49,301
and that was already paid for to a non profit
which was much less cost wise but the council felt
that they wanted to do something independently
so that was the decision that was made .

298
00:31:49,301 --> 00:31:53,910
that they will fund that and well be
in full cooperation with that .

299
00:31:53,910 --> 00:31:59,910
chief what was the limitations on the two positions
based on the findings of the audit .

300
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:08,279
there wasnt a two year term or anything
no , were not sure what the total time frame
pending the audit .

301
00:32:08,279 --> 00:32:19,183
so the only thing that i asked was that it provide and fit
the national fire protection agencies
associations guidelines .

302
00:32:19,183 --> 00:32:25,953
so they accepted it in that fashion
so im very comfortable , it doesnt matter
who they hire .

303
00:32:25,953 --> 00:32:33,953
when do you anticipate the audit being complete
i have no idea cause they havent chosen an auditor ,
an auditor firm yet .

304
00:32:34,870 --> 00:32:43,340
so i guess that would be just disappointing
if you hire the two bodies , got em on
and the audit finishes six months later
and then those bodies are adjusted .

305
00:32:43,340 --> 00:32:52,240
there is that possibility but going into that
theyll be fine for the fiscal year
cause i believe you have the funding for one year .

306
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:55,830
all positions are only for one year with a active budget .

307
00:32:55,830 --> 00:33:03,915
so technically we got the positions
but we dont have the funding for the positions
so we have to make adjustments for that as well .

308
00:33:03,915 --> 00:33:11,915
so those are the kinds of things
thank you
okay well it didnt show em on our
yeah but theyre funded .

309
00:33:12,310 --> 00:33:13,560
thank you im sorry ive just been corrected .

310
00:33:13,519 --> 00:33:15,269
funded out of the current budget .

311
00:33:15,920 --> 00:33:24,046
yeah the f loan , the fyet budget which kicks
in july 1st but they give positions at mine .

312
00:33:24,046 --> 00:33:26,550
okay that was good .

313
00:33:26,990 --> 00:33:31,743
and thats awesome cause we were
under the assumption that , cause it didnt show up
on our spreadsheet .

314
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:34,461
sir , thank you .

315
00:33:37,960 --> 00:33:44,225
all right , and some of the notable items
that will need more funding moving forward
is our helicopter .

316
00:33:44,225 --> 00:33:59,981
the new contracts came out and it was slightly higher
of course you know the last contract was done
four years ago on a annual cost basis
so that needs to be adjusted at some point in time .

317
00:33:59,981 --> 00:34:03,981
there was discussion about eliminating
our ocean safety battalion chief .

318
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:17,990
that got put in back in there as well as funding
and so my whole thing was i just wanted
to move it from our admin program
to the ocean safety program so i could keep all
of that money and funding and personnel

319
00:34:17,990 --> 00:34:21,506
in that same program .

320
00:34:21,506 --> 00:34:27,006
a couple minor adjustments were taking out
of our maintenance program .

321
00:34:27,145 --> 00:34:38,645
they moved our four mechanics to the operations program
and we still dont understand how and why
that happened but the funding was maintained .

322
00:34:38,410 --> 00:34:51,410
funding maintained which is
they just moved to operations so
kind of a interesting process , not sure
what the whole thoughts were behind that
but it doesnt really affect us and were gonna

323
00:34:50,810 --> 00:35:00,341
manage it the same so just a clarification
to the board .

324
00:35:00,341 --> 00:35:14,341
any questions on 7c
all right having none moving forward 7d
so the maui fire department standards of covered
accreditation report .

325
00:35:14,378 --> 00:35:23,010
last month we handed out a folder that included
those two reports .

326
00:35:23,010 --> 00:35:37,230
and im not sure if anybody was able
to go through that and may have some questions
but what id like to do is go over the first
report which is called the standards of cover .

327
00:35:37,230 --> 00:35:43,030
and that information is compiled internally
by our people .

328
00:35:43,030 --> 00:35:53,445
so through dispatch and all of our report management system
all of those data is provided for you .

329
00:35:53,445 --> 00:36:02,215
and in this standards of cover the data and information
shows where we need to improve .

330
00:36:02,215 --> 00:36:17,970
so this is the final report for that
and it covers every aspect of our response
and how our emergency areas that we cover

331
00:36:17,900 --> 00:36:18,900
for all the districts .

332
00:36:19,260 --> 00:36:27,803
so , youre gonna see some different
response times in different areas based
on the distances and the resources .

333
00:36:27,803 --> 00:36:44,467
so if anybody has any questions on the standards of cover
this is a quite robust document
so even if its not at this time you know

334
00:36:44,467 --> 00:36:48,808
let the chair know or me and ill be able
to answer the questions for you .

335
00:36:48,808 --> 00:36:53,885
so a lot of work , about a year and a half of work
went into this document .

336
00:36:53,885 --> 00:36:57,895
and it is all part of the accreditation process .

337
00:36:57,895 --> 00:37:11,640
i have a question chief , you know for that accreditation
the response from the station to the scene what is the time
part of the crediting , like twelve minutes
its all dependent ,

338
00:37:11,752 --> 00:37:15,500
its all dependent for district and what we provided
to the accreditation board .

339
00:37:15,689 --> 00:37:21,939
so for instance any city area its about sixteen minutes ,
twelve to sixteen minutes , depending .

340
00:37:22,490 --> 00:37:24,390
and thats for your first and second .

341
00:37:24,390 --> 00:37:29,890
then like the , say like , cause theres a big gap
between paia and hana
yes .

342
00:37:30,204 --> 00:37:46,796
now would that fall under a different category
because of its geographical
yes , it falls under a rural timeline
and even those we dont meet because of our roadways
and the distance .

343
00:37:46,796 --> 00:38:00,550
just a comment ,
i thought this was pretty awesome , lot of work ,
you can see that a lot of work went into it
and you know being a former member it's very impressive

344
00:38:00,151 --> 00:38:06,946
to see all this work of documenting
that our department does .

345
00:38:06,946 --> 00:38:23,200
and you know , did you put a team together
to put this
yes ,
so you know for about seven years weve been asking
for a accreditation manager just one person .

346
00:38:23,578 --> 00:38:31,451
and we all know that that one person
wouldnt be able to compile anything like this
at any point even if they did that for twenty four hours a day .

347
00:38:31,451 --> 00:38:42,545
so what we did is we put a team together
and what we call it is a cadre system ,
so basically like instructors and what have you
but we put together a team to help
with this accreditation process .

348
00:38:42,545 --> 00:38:44,295
so we put teams for the standard of cover .

349
00:38:44,530 --> 00:38:48,280
we put teams for the emergency response areas .

350
00:38:48,600 --> 00:38:49,850
we put teams for all of those things .

351
00:38:50,020 --> 00:38:56,280
so some of the over time that is brought up
goes into that process .

352
00:38:56,280 --> 00:39:04,725
we did not pay the accreditation board anything
other than to pay for the travel of the individuals
coming out cause theyre non profit .

353
00:39:04,725 --> 00:39:15,459
but they are the experts in this area of management
so i believe that this process was very effective
and efficient .

354
00:39:15,459 --> 00:39:20,776
and they help us to provide these kinds of documents
for you .

355
00:39:20,776 --> 00:39:23,276
thank your commissioner some time for that .

356
00:39:23,690 --> 00:39:38,387
now any more questions on the standards of cover
chief one quick question , looking at your
response times again and looking
for hana specifically and in thirteen it was twenty six minutes
what page
oh page fifty ,

357
00:39:38,387 --> 00:39:50,686
fifty , five zero
two thousand and thirteen the fire response was twenty six minutes and
in fifteen it goes to forty five minutes .

358
00:39:50,686 --> 00:40:04,940
whats causing such a dramatic change
in response time for hana
okay so how that works is theyll take
an average the top ninety percent of all responses
during that annual year .

359
00:40:05,110 --> 00:40:14,860
so what that says is that their distant to response
halts were further than the one the ninety percent that was done
the year before .

360
00:40:15,260 --> 00:40:18,981
but they still have to be factored in so theres no way
for us to . . .

361
00:40:18,981 --> 00:40:27,481
so , you know ,
manipulate the data , so the data is what it is .

362
00:40:28,060 --> 00:40:32,345
and so we have to take that ninety percent of all of those calls .

363
00:40:32,345 --> 00:40:35,520
that becomes your average for that year .

364
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:40,990
and im glad that you picked up on that
cause those are the things that the accreditation board
looks at .

365
00:40:40,990 --> 00:40:51,600
so in our tour of the island they saw the challenges
that we have and theyve given suggestions in their report
of how to manage that .

366
00:40:51,850 --> 00:40:54,700
i have a question chief .

367
00:40:54,200 --> 00:41:06,141
yes
i was wondering how many audits has this organization
done with other fire departments
thousands .

368
00:41:06,141 --> 00:41:12,141
we do all of them , all of them except for
theyre the only body that does this internationally
as well as the united states .

369
00:41:12,850 --> 00:41:21,786
and only two hundred and forty two departments in the united states
are accredited out of the ten thousand or so
that are , exist .

370
00:41:21,786 --> 00:41:27,036
i guess you were just unlucky that someone calls
bad feelings call forward .

371
00:41:27,189 --> 00:41:31,939
well absolutely yes , we had some calls that have been
running up to five hours .

372
00:41:32,300 --> 00:41:34,795
so its really , really interesting .

373
00:41:34,660 --> 00:41:34,910
yeah .

374
00:41:34,795 --> 00:41:42,160
when you take them on a tour then you
take them around totally around the island they know
that theres no station in kipahulu .

375
00:41:43,160 --> 00:41:44,910
its really not .

376
00:41:44,338 --> 00:41:57,088
so its really good that we go through
the data , the statistics and really work out
because our constituents need to understand
what we are up against .

377
00:41:57,610 --> 00:42:01,945
and then so this information helps us provide
what we need in a budget as well right .

378
00:42:01,945 --> 00:42:11,195
so like i said our open arms to that audit
from a third party , and this was a third party ,
but well do it all over again .

379
00:42:11,740 --> 00:42:13,990
its not an issue for us , we have nothing to hide .

380
00:42:14,100 --> 00:42:18,600
we wanna learn more and we want to be able
to provide that information as much as possible .

381
00:42:17,328 --> 00:42:21,828
this information was provided to each council member
yes .

382
00:42:25,530 --> 00:42:29,030
all right moving over to the next report ,
which is the accreditation report .

383
00:42:28,888 --> 00:42:39,888
this report , if you look on the first page
is composed and written by the four peer assessors
that showed up on maui in january .

384
00:42:40,223 --> 00:42:43,159
and this is the report they provided with us .

385
00:42:43,159 --> 00:42:50,788
the breakdown , the areas that we need to work on .

386
00:42:50,788 --> 00:42:56,718
they also touch on some of the things
that we do very well .

387
00:42:55,718 --> 00:43:02,368
what page is that
it is accreditation report cover page .

388
00:43:03,370 --> 00:43:25,919
the tab.  look for the tab .

389
00:43:25,919 --> 00:43:50,850
so this one is , this report is much more specific
to the needs and what our department needs to work on
and focus because all of the other core competencies
were already met .

390
00:43:50,850 --> 00:44:04,350
so one of the real issues is we have a deadline
for august of this year and based on our budgeting
and what set forward that were not gonna
make that deadline .

391
00:44:06,326 --> 00:44:17,810
so we were hoping to go through this process ,
provide the information and have the cadres work
on all the information that needs to be assessed
and turned in and then theyll come out and

392
00:44:17,810 --> 00:44:30,310
do another assessment and our hopes are to pass
and be accredited officially in march
but thats not gonna happen cause we do not
have the funding to put the teams together
to work on these items .

393
00:44:30,310 --> 00:44:35,743
so were only eight items shy of the total .

394
00:44:35,743 --> 00:44:39,436
most departments go through this process anyway .

395
00:44:39,436 --> 00:44:50,936
so the real issue here is that we invested a lot
of money and time to go through this process
of a self assessor and that was done

396
00:44:51,170 --> 00:44:58,920
in the eighth edition so starting january of two thousand and eighteen
all assessments done after that will have
to be done in the ninth edition .

397
00:44:59,465 --> 00:45:04,640
so theyll be a whole another process that we
have to kind of get all over again .

398
00:45:04,640 --> 00:45:11,390
so i really was trying to get this done
by august of this year but its not gonna be done .

399
00:45:11,390 --> 00:45:22,390
so when you say eighth edition ninth edition
thats how many years that youve been working on it
no , its the editions that the accreditation body
comes out with so they see times .

400
00:45:22,668 --> 00:45:28,168
so i believe the eighth edition has been out
approximately five to six years and theyre
making changes .

401
00:45:28,029 --> 00:45:30,156
oh okay .

402
00:45:30,156 --> 00:45:42,990
right , so they provided us with a window
of opportunity for three years to get it done
and we just were unable so were gonna have
to start from scratch , literally , the next time we
go through this process .

403
00:45:42,990 --> 00:45:49,470
at least your procedures directing us there .

404
00:45:49,470 --> 00:45:57,970
thats great
so theres a lot of positives so that whole
process right there sounds negative
but theres a lot of positives that was learned
through the process .

405
00:45:58,550 --> 00:46:02,375
and were gonna continue to press forward .

406
00:46:02,375 --> 00:46:09,676
so with these equipment
right and that was one of the areas
that we failed these in our facilities .

407
00:46:09,676 --> 00:46:15,248
because we have no real means of managing
maintenance of our facilities .

408
00:46:15,248 --> 00:46:19,498
where as other departments have people
that actually , they have building maintenance repairs .

409
00:46:19,750 --> 00:46:25,493
we have none , we have fifteen facilities and we
have nobody to take care of them .

410
00:46:25,493 --> 00:46:32,743
how many areas did you succeed in
and how many areas did you fail in
we failed in eight .

411
00:46:32,910 --> 00:46:45,381
out of
out of eighty six , i believe .

412
00:46:45,381 --> 00:46:50,381
and those eighty six have to be met .

413
00:46:50,950 --> 00:47:02,530
so theres two hundred and sixty four other ones that we met the majority
of those as well but eight of the core just did not meet .

414
00:47:02,530 --> 00:47:06,030
eight out of eighty six
the chief is up on this .

415
00:47:05,784 --> 00:47:07,034
yeah thats pretty good .

416
00:47:07,010 --> 00:47:20,507
the budget thats being worked on right now
no
or the council for next year
chief , i have a question , i know you provided all

417
00:47:20,563 --> 00:47:24,977
the council people with the information here .

418
00:47:24,977 --> 00:47:34,469
now with a budget process im sure they read
this already a couple times .

419
00:47:34,469 --> 00:47:47,427
who is less responsive to the reason as far as council
what does that mean
whos the less responsive to the needs

420
00:47:47,427 --> 00:47:55,177
of the fire department in the budget
thats very subjective .

421
00:47:55,090 --> 00:47:59,378
I would recommend if you wanted to look into it personally

422
00:47:55,260 --> 00:48:03,339
i know
i would recommend if you want to look
into personally but i dont think the chief
has an opinion on that .

423
00:48:04,130 --> 00:48:06,628
probably have to read the minutes on that .

424
00:48:07,648 --> 00:48:13,075
yes , read the minutes and make your own conclusions .

425
00:48:13,070 --> 00:48:16,075
thank you for the question .

426
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:21,000
so chief i just have one major concern .

427
00:48:21,974 --> 00:48:35,576
the funding that you need to complete
the accreditation was it supported
by the county administration
yes , see before we started off on this process

428
00:48:35,576 --> 00:48:39,826
we went to the classes , we understood what we
needed to do .

429
00:48:40,230 --> 00:48:44,325
we started to front load the process
with whatever funding we had nine years ago .

430
00:48:44,325 --> 00:48:46,547
and every year thus far .

431
00:48:46,547 --> 00:48:55,297
and then two years ago we had to get the mayor
to sign off and support this so he has
supported the process .

432
00:48:55,930 --> 00:48:58,680
its just when it gets to the next level
that its not supported .

433
00:48:59,020 --> 00:49:11,770
so youre pretty close , i know just like
the police department , you go through a review process
internally where you kick around , okay what do we need
you know and then you put it together and things

434
00:49:12,087 --> 00:49:24,587
get cut internally then it goes up
to the mayors office that things being cut
but the final problem is seems like just
to get over that hurdle we need to work a little bit

435
00:49:24,830 --> 00:49:31,092
better with a legislative portion to get the funding
that we need .

436
00:49:31,092 --> 00:49:33,092
yes thats a good question .

437
00:49:33,440 --> 00:49:39,715
so just for clarification purposes , accreditation
is . . .

438
00:49:39,715 --> 00:49:44,815
basically an audit of the department
and its whole operations .

439
00:49:44,815 --> 00:49:55,585
so prior to that , like i said , we front loaded
a lot of things and one of the areas that we did
was our area of certification for our needs
and training for our department members .

440
00:49:55,585 --> 00:50:08,723
that we are up to snuff with and we just try
to get the whole department as a whole
in all of its policies and all of its standing orders

441
00:50:08,723 --> 00:50:12,665
and standard operating guidelines to be
on the same process .

442
00:50:12,665 --> 00:50:15,910
and hopefully one day we'll get the support needed .

443
00:50:15,590 --> 00:50:18,340
youre just the feet .

444
00:50:18,800 --> 00:50:24,951
yes so being shiny is not very far .

445
00:50:24,951 --> 00:50:30,345
its extremely frustrating to come this far
in the process and not being able to finish .

446
00:50:30,345 --> 00:50:32,216
i feel you .

447
00:50:32,216 --> 00:50:46,071
chief what dollar value are we looking at
what is , what would the funding mechanism ,
what would the dollars be that you feel you need
to finish this out
well initially i would say six out of the eight would

448
00:50:46,071 --> 00:50:47,820
come into some overtime .

449
00:50:48,080 --> 00:50:51,261
which would probably be about forty thousand dollars .

450
00:50:51,261 --> 00:51:03,511
okay so forty grand , what else
the other two would come into some processes
and software and what have you for our records
managing .

451
00:51:04,061 --> 00:51:11,811
that we are not sure what the total cost would be
but even if we estimated it at one hundred thousand dollars
or one hundred and fifty thousand dollars thats still in reach .

452
00:51:12,335 --> 00:51:20,629
so for two hundred thousand dollars youd finish this project
i would say yes , thats an estimate , yes .

453
00:51:20,629 --> 00:51:33,431
so once the program , say you got the funding ,
mutual funding for the program to finish you know
meeting the eight things that were not meeting
right now .

454
00:51:33,431 --> 00:51:45,400
has there been any discussion with council
about should they decide to adopt accreditation

455
00:51:45,400 --> 00:51:54,068
is there a big change in pay for the department
no , not at all .

456
00:51:54,068 --> 00:52:03,922
theres no change in pay all its saying is
that our department has met the standards
of accreditation which is higher than a minimum .

457
00:52:03,922 --> 00:52:09,468
thats all were asking because we want to be able
to provide the community with the best possible service .

458
00:52:09,468 --> 00:52:13,968
and a third party would say that
the maui fire department cuts ratings .

459
00:52:13,827 --> 00:52:18,077
that was a goal of this commission when i got hired .

460
00:52:18,838 --> 00:52:25,936
so im just trying to carry on what was asked
of me within my means .

461
00:52:25,936 --> 00:52:43,105
chief i have a follow up question , so it we were
able somehow to get the funding to finish
accreditation is the timing still be a factor
that would still be a huge factor because
theres other departments that we have to work with .

462
00:52:43,105 --> 00:52:46,570
and wed have to have all of their support as well .

463
00:52:46,570 --> 00:53:00,758
so i dont know if three months or two months
would make it happen but if we had the funds
we would try very hard to make it happen .

464
00:53:00,758 --> 00:53:04,008
thats all i could promise you .

465
00:53:04,380 --> 00:53:18,380
is there a way to ask the accreditation board
for an extension without funding
no , we tried that already , in fact i went through
that process in november to ask for an extension
and they basically said the extension would be

466
00:53:18,750 --> 00:53:21,750
to august , september of this year .

467
00:53:22,640 --> 00:53:34,656
but we had to have provided all of the information
moving forward , if not , we would show no accredibility
moving forward so
just to get them to show up in january , to fly here

468
00:53:34,656 --> 00:53:40,246
we crossed a large hurdle to get through that process .

469
00:53:40,246 --> 00:53:43,076
question here .

470
00:53:43,076 --> 00:53:56,576
chief , you know the , as part of their accreditation
process do they also look at how you
staff the department
absolutely
so whats the three battalion chiefs
on the west side and molokai and all that .

471
00:53:56,360 --> 00:53:58,856
was that part of the
yes .

472
00:53:59,680 --> 00:54:04,430
and like taking away those positions , would
that affect accreditation
yes .

473
00:54:04,844 --> 00:54:14,094
so i guess the question for me then is
to ask the council do you guys really want
our department to be accredited or not
because if you do then you need
to staff us correctly .

474
00:54:14,730 --> 00:54:19,299
i think thats the question to be asked .

475
00:54:19,299 --> 00:54:28,029
i mean , if you gotta put it in nuts and bolts
to them right .

476
00:54:28,029 --> 00:54:39,724
because if you say its only gonna cost two hundred thousand more
dollars to be accredited i mean what better
standard to have .

477
00:54:39,724 --> 00:54:44,224
i agree .

478
00:54:44,224 --> 00:54:58,420
i wonder if theres a way that we could send a letter`
up and have the commission of chairs signature
strongly voicing our opinion of the accreditation process
and what it means to finish .

479
00:54:58,420 --> 00:55:12,637
i was wondering how leverage this body
into putting pressure on the mayor and the chair
of county council to take this seriously .

480
00:55:12,637 --> 00:55:32,390
you guys might want to put that out on a agenda item
for next month and that way
its every month that this goes by is one less month
that he's got to be able to
just a suggestion but i would really , if you're gonna

481
00:55:32,730 --> 00:55:50,650
write that letter from this body you may want to get
more detailed solid information and numbers
from the chief rather than some back of the envelope
calculations

482
00:55:50,650 --> 00:56:04,315
if you wanted to write one on your own
i wouldnt suggest saying its from the body .

483
00:56:04,315 --> 00:56:09,969
our power is as a collected group its not
as individuals .

484
00:56:09,969 --> 00:56:14,171
so if there was a motion put on the floor
i dont see it on your agenda page .

485
00:56:14,171 --> 00:56:24,702
so youll put it on the agenda
i would suggest that for such general purposes .

486
00:56:24,702 --> 00:56:35,700
so what we can do members is we can bump
our next meeting date and time and we can have
a request to have item agendized .

487
00:56:35,692 --> 00:56:39,192
we can discuss it at the next meeting .

488
00:56:40,630 --> 00:56:45,541
i will work on providing you with more hard numbers .

489
00:56:45,541 --> 00:56:52,790
any more questions members
i just want to say well done .

490
00:56:54,626 --> 00:57:07,156
this is really , really , really well done
and i think , especially if its not costing any money
for the taxpayers moving forward on this is , in my eyes ,
its a no brainer , job well done .

491
00:57:07,156 --> 00:57:09,337
thank you .

492
00:57:09,337 --> 00:57:21,991
thank you commissioner ka lepta ,
any more questions members
just one more , just a complement again
of what this document does , it really identifies .

493
00:57:21,991 --> 00:57:30,491
being a former member you know, you think
you feel certain ways but here it is
in black and white and some color .

494
00:57:30,962 --> 00:57:36,962
its a really good document even for me
to go through and it and see it .

495
00:57:37,800 --> 00:57:39,249
so thank you .

496
00:57:39,249 --> 00:57:44,999
will this document be available to public
at some point we will put it
on our website .

497
00:57:45,808 --> 00:57:56,951
i appreciate you bringing that up
because its really , you know ,
theres a word thats being tossed around ,
quite often , transparency .

498
00:57:56,951 --> 00:58:06,544
and i think going through the accreditation
process can not send that message stronger
to the people than transparency .

499
00:58:06,544 --> 00:58:10,572
i dont even understand how its not supported .

500
00:58:10,572 --> 00:58:19,072
its extremely important for our community
and our visitors to know that theyre coming
into a accredited area .

501
00:58:19,370 --> 00:58:21,870
and for us to want to do that .

502
00:58:22,420 --> 00:58:27,436
it takes a lot of work from all of our members
within the department wanting to make that happen .

503
00:58:27,436 --> 00:58:32,436
you know , nobody wants somebody to come
in their back yard and tell em how for clean
their yard .

504
00:58:33,370 --> 00:58:45,870
but were willing to see hey how can we make it better
and it goes for everything i mean they came in
and helped us with our ocean safety processes as well
they turned us onto more information in that realm

505
00:58:46,280 --> 00:58:49,570
so once we go into the ninth edition all of that has
to be clear as well .

506
00:58:49,570 --> 00:58:55,185
so right now they wouldve allowed us to move forward
then have that a work in progress .

507
00:58:55,185 --> 00:59:01,654
so i dont know how much that will cost us ,
so thats an added thing moving on to the ninth as well .

508
00:59:01,654 --> 00:59:05,654
but thank you very much for the discussion
and the support .

509
00:59:06,187 --> 00:59:10,220
we hope that some point in time
that this can be achieved .

510
00:59:10,220 --> 00:59:12,500
for you as well as the community .

511
00:59:12,500 --> 00:59:20,233
thank you for the opportunity .

512
00:59:20,233 --> 00:59:33,950
all right , so quick announcement next meeting
is thursday june 8th at the fire prevention bureau
at 10:30 in the morning .

513

before but you have any questions thank your chair yeah dont know whos chair right now but just like know both you guys have been many commissions before you kinda know the drill our chair has arrived relieved thank you vice chair youre time lets move item number six emergency management good morning you have front you our monthly report just few items had received our staff specialist three list and actually were able conduct interviews yesterday and were hoping make offer one the candidates that interviewed for that position well full staff that person takes the position far training and exercises finished our eoc basic training for our partners that was over about five week period where they were coming mondays that and now were moving into hurricane preparedness for community things there was zika tabletop exercise which seems little bit odd because the focus has kind moved away from zika but were getting into the season again where mosquitoes and high travel had that particular exercise the preparedness side our harp program continuing west maui theyve been very successful terms good turnout weve had lot repeat personnel werent sure the people would come each meeting every month but weve seen steady participation that and after this month which tropical cyclone they move away from hazard awareness into actual planning well see how many people start come out for the planning piece which more pencil the paper kind stuff ill just move down the response piece the emergent event guess well call that weve been involved the rat lung worm disease lot times people forget that also are participating with the department health during those types events really were just were not the lead that department health always remains the lead that but continue support terms coordination and especially with their messaging piece you have any questions the report happy take those otherwise ill move into the piece that commissioner john kyle asked about last week last month with the activation levels questions okay you have two handouts front you the first one nice bright color coded one our eoc activation levels used just have three but then fema and the national incident management system had recommended four tier which was very much similar what had just didnt have our day day operations there which level four you can see starts level four normal operations steady state thats today its blue because call blue sky day you know its just nice day were always monitoring for things that might happen with notice event the eoc not staffed that time the number three enhanced steady state something has come that maybe requires pay attention little bit more dont have the eoc staffed really that point but our standby person who call standby throughout the evening hours and off hours monitoring that actively looking notifications from the weather service whatever event might level two partial activation thats the most common thing that have after level three thats when have some our partners maybe event thats focused specific geographic area its not island county wide well have the emergency support functions who would affected that particular event and then level one activation full activation have all our county partners and state and other partners staffing all the emergency support functions anticipation something that know coming its happening occurring are speaking and the response and recoverys going require additional resources than just one two particular agencies the next page just made quick kind glance there are some events that automatically trigger certain activation level and thats what you see that chart there with tropical cyclone when the forecast advisories are issued again see that coming starts out with just our staff and maybe weve made notification for people who have something their day day operations that they would then escalates from watch warning youll see that activation level then scales two and one the one that most ill say difficult maybe difficults not the right word the one thats the most fluid probably flood scenario because flood watch will come out and itll maybe county wide and know theres potential for heavy rains etcetera and then when they issue advisory that means that heavy rains are occurring certain area and flooding may imminent but then when goes warning level its more than just nuisance flooding the advisory what they call nuisance flooding there will flooding and ponding the roads but its not getting into peoples homes its not endangering life much maybe properties but not higher level when warning our staff automatically goes into the eoc because during warning for flood goes from nothing something pretty quickly again weve already been contact with our partners they obviously know its raining outside but were monitoring the situation and just contact with our partners that call when for the standby eoc person call the other partners judgment call ill say and thats the one think that the most fluid far warning doesnt automatically bring the other partners and then things that are notice event like earthquake mass casualty they happen when they happen and then thats automatic eoc activation level charles did that answer your question yes answers lot questions but still have few questions sure now far districts and notification and actions they take lanai molokai lahaina now what point you recommend that they take action measures prepare for storm those are the same what here this island its county wide notification its the other ones like the flood again that its happening strictly specific district those are the ones that are little bit more challenging for but would recommend similar what have here and can talk still havent been able hire our part time person those districts but that person would the one that would staff and activate either themself with partners those eocs okay well guess what looking lets say storm coming and theres certain measures that district supervisors for the public works can take guess whats the trigger point for their activation recommendation from you the public works start preparing those would usually start happening watch level and those the eoc were not were recommending for the departments activate their own plan public works has their own triggers for that and they match with ours when call watch thats why too were always consultation with the weather service when theyre gonna make that call because does trigger actions departmental emergency plans there standard far measures that can taken once they get trigger point for example you know course molokai for example steven arcy used start filling his trucks start staging them critical areas there standard that you know that the public works takes yeah same thing okay both for tsunami and tropical cyclones watch triggers actions each those departments and basically standard plan every district supervisor has their own plan and are others aware that plan its standard plan department wide public works has their plan when into one these levels cant speak their personnel far how well they know their internal plan next question would far the utility companies that are very important whats your dialogue with them far their notifications cause they can take the same precautionary measures too that they you know theres points where water departments theyll shut down you know theyll lock down far dialogue with them where are you when does that happen sure the way have the eoc staffed now our operations section have three branches and one the branches infrastructure and the meco department water supply with the county the telephone company our public and private utilities are part infrastructure branch theyre called and theyre our call list okay they are yup theyre part our all the water departments all the private guys they all come not all the private water guys come they have liaison because dont have that much room when notify them they notify know theres some partnerships like maui yes yes okay they have representative that attends something they have one that represents private water yes thank you youre welcome travis would you interested that part time position know keep your eyes out when comes open had question goes back the rat lung worm disease huh there known hot spot the origin the disease itself here maui general general there place where the rats have the disease and thats why its coming out that area they know not that aware mean here its been weve been seeing obviously east maui but know the big island was linked cow heart and slug there right well that was just that particular incident but theyve had rat lung worm the big island for long time already and think when they started some more research theres been individual instances the other the other counties well but the key for again cause weve seen little bit panic with that particular disease where people are not buying local produce and just want stress that its not that you cannot buy the local produce comes down the consumers the farmers are doing what they can and then the intermediary doing what they can make sure that its clean and safe but consumer its also make sure that were washing and thats all takes washing properly doesnt even take you know those special things that theyre selling the store those sprays and things like that you take the time and wash your produce and its not just should tell folks all produce and thats kind the slogan that were working wash all produce all the time even says pre washed even its from the mainland cause they have other things their produce too sometimes its just habit that need retrain ourselves community wash all produce all the time any more questions thank you ann thank you let now move item number seven fire department aloha good morning members before you you have our monthly highlights for the month april okay does your team need any questions before move forward but any point time through each item you are welcome ask questions all right item the department highlights for motions and interviews you see there have gone through the process going through our recruit trainees did performance agility tests the end march and qualified some people for our openings that have currently have seventeen openings and will starting that class july first this year wanted march excuse may but did not have the funding move forward moves back the average recruit class lasts six and half months that pushes into january two thousand and eighteen our projected retirements are twenty for this year had five thus far anticipate fifteen more that might cause shortage issue going towards the end the year and thats something that try have discussions with council and the mayors office chief yes would you describe little bit more about what you said when you didnt have the funds okay you had delay the training class because you didnt have funds yes our department ran into shortage somewhere around november two thousand and sixteen and move forward move around funding from different programs make project til june came with short fall one point two million moving forward payroll and what have you those areas utilized overtime for our training instructors come and help with the process the recruit class and that was issue and topic and did not have the funding pay for the recruits during this fiscal year thats where the shortages are and have you thought about going back county council asking for special assessment did and sorry for pulling you into this provided the information for them and money was added our budget for this fiscal year handle but there was lengthy discussion about your million and half short roughly and what will that grow the end the fiscal year hopefully not much ask for budget amendment move forward the handle all those payroll issues and had the amendment believe its second reading not mistaken for next week and hopefully get that and nothing drastic happens between now and june but this our fifth year that weve gone for budget amendment let guess the first four didnt get theres question was gonna ask you the first four every year thus far this our fifth year that weve gone for budget amendment every year yeah every year weve gotten budget amendment for the shortage thank you chief youre welcome you said every year you had new budget every year its ranged from eighty thousand dollars two million dollars present our budget those are the things that into the process from the mayors office and then gets cut during the budget deliberations with council lot our projections are pretty close what need but then the cuts are made and have back through this process over and over again curious who you submit the request the chair budget chair yes the process goes through transmittal form which goes from the mayors office budget from budget the chair the council and then from the budget mean from the council chair the budget chair and then theyll either schedule not thank you youre welcome next question here sure chief you know when you have recruitment for classes how advertised online well the maui news and believe the star advertiser but doesnt into the molokai district cant answer that question you cant answer cause thats how molokai people dont know when the recruitments happen yeah that comes out our personal department but can pass that information can get that advertisement too commissioner notifications yeah kind doesnt necessarily through the fire department the department personnel services handles that you can ask for quest but its not something handled internally the department but ill ask cause mean think that would effective way get more molokai people apply because they just dont know about wonder our personnel services has notification list they you just put your name and now they have electronically individual can even theyre not looking for anybody provide their information that list and then when they send the list out the first mail out the newspaper then would come them the following monday usually goes out sunday and monday theyll get email blast long their email address information correct and updated guess you can let the newspapers molokai know that have people just sign thats good idea should pay for itself though man itd sure alleviate the non employment issue based that information that request will send that information department personnel services thank you members like welcome miss cher betas the meeting sorry all right moving from seven item number incident reports can look your handouts for the month april and you have any questions questions just noticed that what you call false alarms stays pretty consistent the amount yeah sure does yeah any questions members just one question about this false alarms are they from alarm companies are they from people actually pulling alarms its mix both believe spoke not sure was last month the month before but anytime have the alarm companies issue and its more than three times send them letter they usually get them pretty quick there anybody youre actually tracking whose constant repeat false alarm goes the car fire and hazard have one that separate ours passed before the police false alarm bill have process that can use after those individuals companies that have false alarms mean anything that you know you can reduce you know this cry wolf syndrome and lot times when get rash this its due bad weather electronically things dont run properly thats when youll see the influx and doesnt just happen but police department civil events and emergency management the big problem noticed when was working was alarms werent being serviced right and the batteries werent being replaced and when there was power outage youre supposed switch that battery thats backed but the batteries dead triggers the alarm think but they really need somebody really needs look ensuring that alarm companies service these alarms regular basis prevent this excessive response false alarms for the most part have excess six thousand commercial properties and all those have fire alarms were talking fifty out those six thousand that know think the ratio really good considering anything excessive reach out through our fire prevention bureau and through our inspection process that the checklist all times looked daily basis throughout our community hopefully that helps thank you youre welcome chief you made question the alarms all these commercial properties like multiples quick malls and all they all have lock boxes you know requirement from they start off new require them the lock box and majority them have that try not use that lesson yeah thats available any more questions okay item fire department two thousand fiscal year two thousand and eighteen budget updates which the three all right out our eighty three items that put forward through the mayors office only four those items made through council and then gonna talk little bit about some the cuts all right you know county wide funding where they try put most the equipment along with department public works and environmental management they put that fund for our ladder truck that cut four hundred thousand dollars from one point two million believe was eight hundred that doesnt get sufficient ladder truck but were the process putting that out bid and see where ends and then maybe going back ask for amendment for the bid that comes the winning bid have question chief sure you know when they make these cuts they consult with you guys experts their decision why theyre making the cuts when you guys know that something that you need smart thank you for that question that really good question the answer know they try research with other departments within hawaii what one the measuring points that they have really consider specifications what are the differences and what are different needs the other counties opposed ours were pretty clear what our needs are and not sure what the whole process about their decisions are but this not the first time that thats happened really puts the damper the whole process and the whole timing the contracts when they actually out thank you for that question the good news the two battalion chiefs that this commission well our administration has been fighting for has been put for limited term what that means were able hire the two people but theyll limited not permanent and the findings audit that they also approved that council will pay for whatever that findings come out will either make those positions permanent eliminate them completely not sure how that process gonna work still waiting the information for that but our department will full cooperation with that audit one the suggestions had was that the accreditation full blown audit the department and that was already paid for non profit which was much less cost wise but the council felt that they wanted something independently that was the decision that was made that they will fund that and well full cooperation with that chief what was the limitations the two positions based the findings the audit there wasnt two year term anything were not sure what the total time frame pending the audit the only thing that asked was that provide and fit the national fire protection agencies associations guidelines they accepted that fashion very comfortable doesnt matter who they hire when you anticipate the audit being complete have idea cause they havent chosen auditor auditor firm yet guess that would just disappointing you hire the two bodies got and the audit finishes six months later and then those bodies are adjusted there that possibility but going into that theyll fine for the fiscal year cause believe you have the funding for one year all positions are only for one year with active budget technically got the positions but dont have the funding for the positions have make adjustments for that well those are the kinds things thank you okay well didnt show our yeah but theyre funded thank you sorry ive just been corrected funded out the current budget yeah the loan the fyet budget which kicks july but they give positions mine okay that was good and thats awesome cause were under the assumption that cause didnt show our spreadsheet sir thank you all right and some the notable items that will need more funding moving forward our helicopter the new contracts came out and was slightly higher course you know the last contract was done four years ago annual cost basis that needs adjusted some point time there was discussion about eliminating our ocean safety battalion chief that got put back there well funding and whole thing was just wanted move from our admin program the ocean safety program could keep all that money and funding and personnel that same program couple minor adjustments were taking out our maintenance program they moved our four mechanics the operations program and still dont understand how and why that happened but the funding was maintained funding maintained which they just moved operations kind interesting process not sure what the whole thoughts were behind that but doesnt really affect and were gonna manage the same just clarification the board any questions all right having none moving forward the maui fire department standards covered accreditation report last month handed out folder that included those two reports and not sure anybody was able through that and may have some questions but what like over the first report which called the standards cover and that information compiled internally our people through dispatch and all our report management system all those data provided for you and this standards cover the data and information shows where need improve this the final report for that and covers every aspect our response and how our emergency areas that cover for all the districts youre gonna see some different response times different areas based the distances and the resources anybody has any questions the standards cover this quite robust document even its not this time you know let the chair know and ill able answer the questions for you lot work about year and half work went into this document and all part the accreditation process have question chief you know for that accreditation the response from the station the scene what the time part the crediting like twelve minutes its all dependent its all dependent for district and what provided the accreditation board for instance any city area its about sixteen minutes twelve sixteen minutes depending and thats for your first and second then like the say like cause theres big gap between paia and hana yes now would that fall under different category because its geographical yes falls under rural timeline and even those dont meet because our roadways and the distance just comment thought this was pretty awesome lot work you can see that lot work went into and you know being former member it's very impressive see all this work documenting that our department does and you know did you put team together put this yes you know for about seven years weve been asking for accreditation manager just one person and all know that that one person wouldnt able compile anything like this any point even they did that for twenty four hours day what did put team together and what call cadre system basically like instructors and what have you but put together team help with this accreditation process put teams for the standard cover put teams for the emergency response areas put teams for all those things some the over time that brought goes into that process did not pay the accreditation board anything other than pay for the travel the individuals coming out cause theyre non profit but they are the experts this area management believe that this process was very effective and efficient and they help provide these kinds documents for you thank your commissioner some time for that now any more questions the standards cover chief one quick question looking your response times again and looking for hana specifically and thirteen was twenty six minutes what page page fifty fifty five zero two thousand and thirteen the fire response was twenty six minutes and fifteen goes forty five minutes whats causing such dramatic change response time for hana okay how that works theyll take average the top ninety percent all responses during that annual year what that says that their distant response halts were further than the one the ninety percent that was done the year before but they still have factored theres way for you know manipulate the data the data what and have take that ninety percent all those calls that becomes your average for that year and glad that you picked that cause those are the things that the accreditation board looks our tour the island they saw the challenges that have and theyve given suggestions their report how manage that have question chief yes was wondering how many audits has this organization done with other fire departments thousands all them all them except for theyre the only body that does this internationally well the united states and only two hundred and forty two departments the united states are accredited out the ten thousand that are exist guess you were just unlucky that someone calls bad feelings call forward well absolutely yes had some calls that have been running five hours its really really interesting yeah when you take them tour then you take them around totally around the island they know that theres station kipahulu its really not its really good that through the data the statistics and really work out because our constituents need understand what are against and then this information helps provide what need budget well right like said our open arms that audit from third party and this was third party but well all over again its not issue for have nothing hide wanna learn more and want able provide that information much possible this information was provided each council member yes all right moving over the next report which the accreditation report this report you look the first page composed and written the four peer assessors that showed maui january and this the report they provided with the breakdown the areas that need work they also touch some the things that very well what page that accreditation report cover page the tab. look for the tab this one this report much more specific the needs and what our department needs work and focus because all the other core competencies were already met one the real issues have deadline for august this year and based our budgeting and what set forward that were not gonna make that deadline were hoping through this process provide the information and have the cadres work all the information that needs assessed and turned and then theyll come out and another assessment and our hopes are pass and accredited officially march but thats not gonna happen cause not have the funding put the teams together work these items were only eight items shy the total most departments through this process anyway the real issue here that invested lot money and time through this process self assessor and that was done the eighth edition starting january two thousand and eighteen all assessments done after that will have done the ninth edition theyll whole another process that have kind get all over again really was trying get this done august this year but its not gonna done when you say eighth edition ninth edition thats how many years that youve been working its the editions that the accreditation body comes out with they see times believe the eighth edition has been out approximately five six years and theyre making changes okay right they provided with window opportunity for three years get done and just were unable were gonna have start from scratch literally the next time through this process least your procedures directing there thats great theres lot positives that whole process right there sounds negative but theres lot positives that was learned through the process and were gonna continue press forward with these equipment right and that was one the areas that failed these our facilities because have real means managing maintenance our facilities where other departments have people that actually they have building maintenance repairs have none have fifteen facilities and have nobody take care them how many areas did you succeed and how many areas did you fail failed eight out out eighty six believe and those eighty six have met theres two hundred and sixty four other ones that met the majority those well but eight the core just did not meet eight out eighty six the chief this yeah thats pretty good the budget thats being worked right now the council for next year chief have question know you provided all the council people with the information here now with budget process sure they read this already couple times who less responsive the reason far council what does that mean whos the less responsive the needs the fire department the budget thats very subjective would recommend you wanted look into personally know would recommend you want look into personally but dont think the chief has opinion that probably have read the minutes that yes read the minutes and make your own conclusions thank you for the question chief just have one major concern the funding that you need complete the accreditation was supported the county administration yes see before started off this process went the classes understood what needed started front load the process with whatever funding had nine years ago and every year thus far and then two years ago had get the mayor sign off and support this has supported the process its just when gets the next level that its not supported youre pretty close know just like the police department you through review process internally where you kick around okay what need you know and then you put together and things get cut internally then goes the mayors office that things being cut but the final problem seems like just get over that hurdle need work little bit better with legislative portion get the funding that need yes thats good question just for clarification purposes accreditation basically audit the department and its whole operations prior that like said front loaded lot things and one the areas that did was our area certification for our needs and training for our department members that are snuff with and just try get the whole department whole all its policies and all its standing orders and standard operating guidelines the same process and hopefully one day we'll get the support needed youre just the feet yes being shiny not very far its extremely frustrating come this far the process and not being able finish feel you chief what dollar value are looking what what would the funding mechanism what would the dollars that you feel you need finish this out well initially would say six out the eight would come into some overtime which would probably about forty thousand dollars okay forty grand what else the other two would come into some processes and software and what have you for our records managing that are not sure what the total cost would but even estimated one hundred thousand dollars one hundred and fifty thousand dollars thats still reach for two hundred thousand dollars youd finish this project would say yes thats estimate yes once the program say you got the funding mutual funding for the program finish you know meeting the eight things that were not meeting right now has there been any discussion with council about should they decide adopt accreditation there big change pay for the department not all theres change pay all its saying that our department has met the standards accreditation which higher than minimum thats all were asking because want able provide the community with the best possible service and third party would say that the maui fire department cuts ratings that was goal this commission when got hired just trying carry what was asked within means chief have follow question were able somehow get the funding finish accreditation the timing still factor that would still huge factor because theres other departments that have work with and wed have have all their support well dont know three months two months would make happen but had the funds would try very hard make happen thats all could promise you there way ask the accreditation board for extension without funding tried that already fact went through that process november ask for extension and they basically said the extension would august september this year but had have provided all the information moving forward not would show accredibility moving forward just get them show january fly here crossed large hurdle get through that process question here chief you know the part their accreditation process they also look how you staff the department absolutely whats the three battalion chiefs the west side and molokai and all that was that part the yes and like taking away those positions would that affect accreditation yes guess the question for then ask the council you guys really want our department accredited not because you then you need staff correctly think thats the question asked mean you gotta put nuts and bolts them right because you say its only gonna cost two hundred thousand more dollars accredited mean what better standard have agree wonder theres way that could send letter` and have the commission chairs signature strongly voicing our opinion the accreditation process and what means finish was wondering how leverage this body into putting pressure the mayor and the chair county council take this seriously you guys might want put that out agenda item for next month and that way its every month that this goes one less month that he's got able just suggestion but would really you're gonna write that letter from this body you may want get more detailed solid information and numbers from the chief rather than some back the envelope calculations you wanted write one your own wouldnt suggest saying its from the body our power collected group its not individuals there was motion put the floor dont see your agenda page youll put the agenda would suggest that for such general purposes what can members can bump our next meeting date and time and can have request have item agendized can discuss the next meeting will work providing you with more hard numbers any more questions members just want say well done this really really really well done and think especially its not costing any money for the taxpayers moving forward this eyes its brainer job well done thank you thank you commissioner lepta any more questions members just one more just complement again what this document does really identifies being former member you know, you think you feel certain ways but here black and white and some color its really good document even for through and and see thank you will this document available public some point will put our website appreciate you bringing that because its really you know theres word thats being tossed around quite often transparency and think going through the accreditation process can not send that message stronger the people than transparency dont even understand how its not supported its extremely important for our community and our visitors know that theyre coming into accredited area and for want that takes lot work from all our members within the department wanting make that happen you know nobody wants somebody come their back yard and tell how for clean their yard but were willing see hey how can make better and goes for everything mean they came and helped with our ocean safety processes well they turned onto more information that realm once into the ninth edition all that has clear well right now they wouldve allowed move forward then have that work progress dont know how much that will cost thats added thing moving the ninth well but thank you very much for the discussion and the support hope that some point time that this can achieved for you well the community thank you for the opportunity all right quick announcement next meeting

yeah dont know whos chair right now but just like know both you guys have been many commissions before you kinda know the drill our chair has arrived relieved thank you vice chair youre time lets move item number six emergency management good morning you have front you our monthly report just few items had received our staff specialist three list and actually were able conduct interviews yesterday and were hoping make offer one the candidates that interviewed for that position well full staff that person takes the position far training and exercises finished our eoc basic training for our partners that was over about five week period where they were coming mondays that and now were moving into hurricane preparedness for community things there was zika tabletop exercise which seems little bit odd because the focus has kind moved away from zika but were getting into the season again where mosquitoes and high travel had that particular exercise the preparedness side our harp program continuing west maui theyve been very successful terms good turnout weve had lot repeat personnel werent sure the people would come each meeting every month but weve seen steady participation that and after this month which tropical cyclone they move away from hazard awareness into actual planning well see how many people start come out for the planning piece which more pencil the paper kind stuff ill just move down the response piece the emergent event guess well call that weve been involved the rat lung worm disease lot times people forget that also are participating with the department health during those types events really were just were not the lead that department health always remains the lead that but continue support terms coordination and especially with their messaging piece you have any questions the report happy take those otherwise ill move into the piece that commissioner john kyle asked about last week last month with the activation levels questions okay you have two handouts front you the first one nice bright color coded one our eoc activation levels used just have three but then fema and the national incident management system had recommended four tier which was very much similar what had just didnt have our day day operations there which level four you can see starts level four normal operations steady state thats today its blue because call blue sky day you know its just nice day were always monitoring for things that might happen with notice event the eoc not staffed that time the number three enhanced steady state something has come that maybe requires pay attention little bit more dont have the eoc staffed really that point but our standby person who call standby throughout the evening hours and off hours monitoring that actively looking notifications from the weather service whatever event might level two partial activation thats the most common thing that have after level three thats when have some our partners maybe event thats focused specific geographic area its not island county wide well have the emergency support functions who would affected that particular event and then level one activation full activation have all our county partners and state and other partners staffing all the emergency support functions anticipation something that know coming its happening occurring are speaking and the response and recoverys going require additional resources than just one two particular agencies the next page just made quick kind glance there are some events that automatically trigger certain activation level and thats what you see that chart there with tropical cyclone when the forecast advisories are issued again see that coming starts out with just our staff and maybe weve made notification for people who have something their day day operations that they would then escalates from watch warning youll see that activation level then scales two and one the one that most ill say difficult maybe difficults not the right word the one thats the most fluid probably flood scenario because flood watch will come out and itll maybe county wide and know theres potential for heavy rains etcetera and then when they issue advisory that means that heavy rains are occurring certain area and flooding may imminent but then when goes warning level its more than just nuisance flooding the advisory what they call nuisance flooding there will flooding and ponding the roads but its not getting into peoples homes its not endangering life much maybe properties but not higher level when warning our staff automatically goes into the eoc because during warning for flood goes from nothing something pretty quickly again weve already been contact with our partners they obviously know its raining outside but were monitoring the situation and just contact with our partners that call when for the standby eoc person call the other partners judgment call ill say and thats the one think that the most fluid far warning doesnt automatically bring the other partners and then things that are notice event like earthquake mass casualty they happen when they happen and then thats automatic eoc activation level charles did that answer your question yes answers lot questions but still have few questions sure now far districts and notification and actions they take lanai molokai lahaina now what point you recommend that they take action measures prepare for storm those are the same what here this island its county wide notification its the other ones like the flood again that its happening strictly specific district those are the ones that are little bit more challenging for but would recommend similar what have here and can talk still havent been able hire our part time person those districts but that person would the one that would staff and activate either themself with partners those eocs okay well guess what looking lets say storm coming and theres certain measures that district supervisors for the public works can take guess whats the trigger point for their activation recommendation from you the public works start preparing those would usually start happening watch level and those the eoc were not were recommending for the departments activate their own plan public works has their own triggers for that and they match with ours when call watch thats why too were always consultation with the weather service when theyre gonna make that call because does trigger actions departmental emergency plans there standard far measures that can taken once they get trigger point for example you know course molokai for example steven arcy used start filling his trucks start staging them critical areas there standard that you know that the public works takes yeah same thing okay both for tsunami and tropical cyclones watch triggers actions each those departments and basically standard plan every district supervisor has their own plan and are others aware that plan its standard plan department wide public works has their plan when into one these levels cant speak their personnel far how well they know their internal plan next question would far the utility companies that are very important whats your dialogue with them far their notifications cause they can take the same precautionary measures too that they you know theres points where water departments theyll shut down you know theyll lock down far dialogue with them where are you when does that happen sure the way have the eoc staffed now our operations section have three branches and one the branches infrastructure and the meco department water supply with the county the telephone company our public and private utilities are part infrastructure branch theyre called and theyre our call list okay they are yup theyre part our all the water departments all the private guys they all come not all the private water guys come they have liaison because dont have that much room when notify them they notify know theres some partnerships like maui yes yes okay they have representative that attends something they have one that represents private water yes thank you youre welcome travis would you interested that part time position know keep your eyes out when comes open had question goes back the rat lung worm disease huh there known hot spot the origin the disease itself here maui general general there place where the rats have the disease and thats why its coming out that area they know not that aware mean here its been weve been seeing obviously east maui but know the big island was linked cow heart and slug there right well that was just that particular incident but theyve had rat lung worm the big island for long time already and think when they started some more research theres been individual instances the other the other counties well but the key for again cause weve seen little bit panic with that particular disease where people are not buying local produce and just want stress that its not that you cannot buy the local produce comes down the consumers the farmers are doing what they can and then the intermediary doing what they can make sure that its clean and safe but consumer its also make sure that were washing and thats all takes washing properly doesnt even take you know those special things that theyre selling the store those sprays and things like that you take the time and wash your produce and its not just should tell folks all produce and thats kind the slogan that were working wash all produce all the time even says pre washed even its from the mainland cause they have other things their produce too sometimes its just habit that need retrain ourselves community wash all produce all the time any more questions thank you ann thank you let now move item number seven fire department aloha good morning members before you you have our monthly highlights for the month april okay does your team need any questions before move forward but any point time through each item you are welcome ask questions all right item the department highlights for motions and interviews you see there have gone through the process going through our recruit trainees did performance agility tests the end march and qualified some people for our openings that have currently have seventeen openings and will starting that class july first this year wanted march excuse may but did not have the funding move forward moves back the average recruit class lasts six and half months that pushes into january two thousand and eighteen our projected retirements are twenty for this year had five thus far anticipate fifteen more that might cause shortage issue going towards the end the year and thats something that try have discussions with council and the mayors office chief yes would you describe little bit more about what you said when you didnt have the funds okay you had delay the training class because you didnt have funds yes our department ran into shortage somewhere around november two thousand and sixteen and move forward move around funding from different programs make project til june came with short fall one point two million moving forward payroll and what have you those areas utilized overtime for our training instructors come and help with the process the recruit class and that was issue and topic and did not have the funding pay for the recruits during this fiscal year thats where the shortages are and have you thought about going back county council asking for special assessment did and sorry for pulling you into this provided the information for them and money was added our budget for this fiscal year handle but there was lengthy discussion about your million and half short roughly and what will that grow the end the fiscal year hopefully not much ask for budget amendment move forward the handle all those payroll issues and had the amendment believe its second reading not mistaken for next week and hopefully get that and nothing drastic happens between now and june but this our fifth year that weve gone for budget amendment let guess the first four didnt get theres question was gonna ask you the first four every year thus far this our fifth year that weve gone for budget amendment every year yeah every year weve gotten budget amendment for the shortage thank you chief youre welcome you said every year you had new budget every year its ranged from eighty thousand dollars two million dollars present our budget those are the things that into the process from the mayors office and then gets cut during the budget deliberations with council lot our projections are pretty close what need but then the cuts are made and have back through this process over and over again curious who you submit the request the chair budget chair yes the process goes through transmittal form which goes from the mayors office budget from budget the chair the council and then from the budget mean from the council chair the budget chair and then theyll either schedule not thank you youre welcome next question here sure chief you know when you have recruitment for classes how advertised online well the maui news and believe the star advertiser but doesnt into the molokai district cant answer that question you cant answer cause thats how molokai people dont know when the recruitments happen yeah that comes out our personal department but can pass that information can get that advertisement too commissioner notifications yeah kind doesnt necessarily through the fire department the department personnel services handles that you can ask for quest but its not something handled internally the department but ill ask cause mean think that would effective way get more molokai people apply because they just dont know about wonder our personnel services has notification list they you just put your name and now they have electronically individual can even theyre not looking for anybody provide their information that list and then when they send the list out the first mail out the newspaper then would come them the following monday usually goes out sunday and monday theyll get email blast long their email address information correct and updated guess you can let the newspapers molokai know that have people just sign thats good idea should pay for itself though man itd sure alleviate the non employment issue based that information that request will send that information department personnel services thank you members like welcome miss cher betas the meeting sorry all right moving from seven item number incident reports can look your handouts for the month april and you have any questions questions just noticed that what you call false alarms stays pretty consistent the amount yeah sure does yeah any questions members just one question about this false alarms are they from alarm companies are they from people actually pulling alarms its mix both believe spoke not sure was last month the month before but anytime have the alarm companies issue and its more than three times send them letter they usually get them pretty quick there anybody youre actually tracking whose constant repeat false alarm goes the car fire and hazard have one that separate ours passed before the police false alarm bill have process that can use after those individuals companies that have false alarms mean anything that you know you can reduce you know this cry wolf syndrome and lot times when get rash this its due bad weather electronically things dont run properly thats when youll see the influx and doesnt just happen but police department civil events and emergency management the big problem noticed when was working was alarms werent being serviced right and the batteries werent being replaced and when there was power outage youre supposed switch that battery thats backed but the batteries dead triggers the alarm think but they really need somebody really needs look ensuring that alarm companies service these alarms regular basis prevent this excessive response false alarms for the most part have excess six thousand commercial properties and all those have fire alarms were talking fifty out those six thousand that know think the ratio really good considering anything excessive reach out through our fire prevention bureau and through our inspection process that the checklist all times looked daily basis throughout our community hopefully that helps thank you youre welcome chief you made question the alarms all these commercial properties like multiples quick malls and all they all have lock boxes you know requirement from they start off new require them the lock box and majority them have that try not use that lesson yeah thats available any more questions okay item fire department two thousand fiscal year two thousand and eighteen budget updates which the three all right out our eighty three items that put forward through the mayors office only four those items made through council and then gonna talk little bit about some the cuts all right you know county wide funding where they try put most the equipment along with department public works and environmental management they put that fund for our ladder truck that cut four hundred thousand dollars from one point two million believe was eight hundred that doesnt get sufficient ladder truck but were the process putting that out bid and see where ends and then maybe going back ask for amendment for the bid that comes the winning bid have question chief sure you know when they make these cuts they consult with you guys experts their decision why theyre making the cuts when you guys know that something that you need smart thank you for that question that really good question the answer know they try research with other departments within hawaii what one the measuring points that they have really consider specifications what are the differences and what are different needs the other counties opposed ours were pretty clear what our needs are and not sure what the whole process about their decisions are but this not the first time that thats happened really puts the damper the whole process and the whole timing the contracts when they actually out thank you for that question the good news the two battalion chiefs that this commission well our administration has been fighting for has been put for limited term what that means were able hire the two people but theyll limited not permanent and the findings audit that they also approved that council will pay for whatever that findings come out will either make those positions permanent eliminate them completely not sure how that process gonna work still waiting the information for that but our department will full cooperation with that audit one the suggestions had was that the accreditation full blown audit the department and that was already paid for non profit which was much less cost wise but the council felt that they wanted something independently that was the decision that was made that they will fund that and well full cooperation with that chief what was the limitations the two positions based the findings the audit there wasnt two year term anything were not sure what the total time frame pending the audit the only thing that asked was that provide and fit the national fire protection agencies associations guidelines they accepted that fashion very comfortable doesnt matter who they hire when you anticipate the audit being complete have idea cause they havent chosen auditor auditor firm yet guess that would just disappointing you hire the two bodies got and the audit finishes six months later and then those bodies are adjusted there that possibility but going into that theyll fine for the fiscal year cause believe you have the funding for one year all positions are only for one year with active budget technically got the positions but dont have the funding for the positions have make adjustments for that well those are the kinds things thank you okay well didnt show our yeah but theyre funded thank you sorry ive just been corrected funded out the current budget yeah the loan the fyet budget which kicks july but they give positions mine okay that was good and thats awesome cause were under the assumption that cause didnt show our spreadsheet sir thank you all right and some the notable items that will need more funding moving forward our helicopter the new contracts came out and was slightly higher course you know the last contract was done four years ago annual cost basis that needs adjusted some point time there was discussion about eliminating our ocean safety battalion chief that got put back there well funding and whole thing was just wanted move from our admin program the ocean safety program could keep all that money and funding and personnel that same program couple minor adjustments were taking out our maintenance program they moved our four mechanics the operations program and still dont understand how and why that happened but the funding was maintained funding maintained which they just moved operations kind interesting process not sure what the whole thoughts were behind that but doesnt really affect and were gonna manage the same just clarification the board any questions all right having none moving forward the maui fire department standards covered accreditation report last month handed out folder that included those two reports and not sure anybody was able through that and may have some questions but what like over the first report which called the standards cover and that information compiled internally our people through dispatch and all our report management system all those data provided for you and this standards cover the data and information shows where need improve this the final report for that and covers every aspect our response and how our emergency areas that cover for all the districts youre gonna see some different response times different areas based the distances and the resources anybody has any questions the standards cover this quite robust document even its not this time you know let the chair know and ill able answer the questions for you lot work about year and half work went into this document and all part the accreditation process have question chief you know for that accreditation the response from the station the scene what the time part the crediting like twelve minutes its all dependent its all dependent for district and what provided the accreditation board for instance any city area its about sixteen minutes twelve sixteen minutes depending and thats for your first and second then like the say like cause theres big gap between paia and hana yes now would that fall under different category because its geographical yes falls under rural timeline and even those dont meet because our roadways and the distance just comment thought this was pretty awesome lot work you can see that lot work went into and you know being former member it's very impressive see all this work documenting that our department does and you know did you put team together put this yes you know for about seven years weve been asking for accreditation manager just one person and all know that that one person wouldnt able compile anything like this any point even they did that for twenty four hours day what did put team together and what call cadre system basically like instructors and what have you but put together team help with this accreditation process put teams for the standard cover put teams for the emergency response areas put teams for all those things some the over time that brought goes into that process did not pay the accreditation board anything other than pay for the travel the individuals coming out cause theyre non profit but they are the experts this area management believe that this process was very effective and efficient and they help provide these kinds documents for you thank your commissioner some time for that now any more questions the standards cover chief one quick question looking your response times again and looking for hana specifically and thirteen was twenty six minutes what page page fifty fifty five zero two thousand and thirteen the fire response was twenty six minutes and fifteen goes forty five minutes whats causing such dramatic change response time for hana okay how that works theyll take average the top ninety percent all responses during that annual year what that says that their distant response halts were further than the one the ninety percent that was done the year before but they still have factored theres way for you know manipulate the data the data what and have take that ninety percent all those calls that becomes your average for that year and glad that you picked that cause those are the things that the accreditation board looks our tour the island they saw the challenges that have and theyve given suggestions their report how manage that have question chief yes was wondering how many audits has this organization done with other fire departments thousands all them all them except for theyre the only body that does this internationally well the united states and only two hundred and forty two departments the united states are accredited out the ten thousand that are exist guess you were just unlucky that someone calls bad feelings call forward well absolutely yes had some calls that have been running five hours its really really interesting yeah when you take them tour then you take them around totally around the island they know that theres station kipahulu its really not its really good that through the data the statistics and really work out because our constituents need understand what are against and then this information helps provide what need budget well right like said our open arms that audit from third party and this was third party but well all over again its not issue for have nothing hide wanna learn more and want able provide that information much possible this information was provided each council member yes all right moving over the next report which the accreditation report this report you look the first page composed and written the four peer assessors that showed maui january and this the report they provided with the breakdown the areas that need work they also touch some the things that very well what page that accreditation report cover page the tab. look for the tab this one this report much more specific the needs and what our department needs work and focus because all the other core competencies were already met one the real issues have deadline for august this year and based our budgeting and what set forward that were not gonna make that deadline were hoping through this process provide the information and have the cadres work all the information that needs assessed and turned and then theyll come out and another assessment and our hopes are pass and accredited officially march but thats not gonna happen cause not have the funding put the teams together work these items were only eight items shy the total most departments through this process anyway the real issue here that invested lot money and time through this process self assessor and that was done the eighth edition starting january two thousand and eighteen all assessments done after that will have done the ninth edition theyll whole another process that have kind get all over again really was trying get this done august this year but its not gonna done when you say eighth edition ninth edition thats how many years that youve been working its the editions that the accreditation body comes out with they see times believe the eighth edition has been out approximately five six years and theyre making changes okay right they provided with window opportunity for three years get done and just were unable were gonna have start from scratch literally the next time through this process least your procedures directing there thats great theres lot positives that whole process right there sounds negative but theres lot positives that was learned through the process and were gonna continue press forward with these equipment right and that was one the areas that failed these our facilities because have real means managing maintenance our facilities where other departments have people that actually they have building maintenance repairs have none have fifteen facilities and have nobody take care them how many areas did you succeed and how many areas did you fail failed eight out out eighty six believe and those eighty six have met theres two hundred and sixty four other ones that met the majority those well but eight the core just did not meet eight out eighty six the chief this yeah thats pretty good the budget thats being worked right now the council for next year chief have question know you provided all the council people with the information here now with budget process sure they read this already couple times who less responsive the reason far council what does that mean whos the less responsive the needs the fire department the budget thats very subjective would recommend you wanted look into personally know would recommend you want look into personally but dont think the chief has opinion that probably have read the minutes that yes read the minutes and make your own conclusions thank you for the question chief just have one major concern the funding that you need complete the accreditation was supported the county administration yes see before started off this process went the classes understood what needed started front load the process with whatever funding had nine years ago and every year thus far and then two years ago had get the mayor sign off and support this has supported the process its just when gets the next level that its not supported youre pretty close know just like the police department you through review process internally where you kick around okay what need you know and then you put together and things get cut internally then goes the mayors office that things being cut but the final problem seems like just get over that hurdle need work little bit better with legislative portion get the funding that need yes thats good question just for clarification purposes accreditation basically audit the department and its whole operations prior that like said front loaded lot things and one the areas that did was our area certification for our needs and training for our department members that are snuff with and just try get the whole department whole all its policies and all its standing orders and standard operating guidelines the same process and hopefully one day we'll get the support needed youre just the feet yes being shiny not very far its extremely frustrating come this far the process and not being able finish feel you chief what dollar value are looking what what would the funding mechanism what would the dollars that you feel you need finish this out well initially would say six out the eight would come into some overtime which would probably about forty thousand dollars okay forty grand what else the other two would come into some processes and software and what have you for our records managing that are not sure what the total cost would but even estimated one hundred thousand dollars one hundred and fifty thousand dollars thats still reach for two hundred thousand dollars youd finish this project would say yes thats estimate yes once the program say you got the funding mutual funding for the program finish you know meeting the eight things that were not meeting right now has there been any discussion with council about should they decide adopt accreditation there big change pay for the department not all theres change pay all its saying that our department has met the standards accreditation which higher than minimum thats all were asking because want able provide the community with the best possible service and third party would say that the maui fire department cuts ratings that was goal this commission when got hired just trying carry what was asked within means chief have follow question were able somehow get the funding finish accreditation the timing still factor that would still huge factor because theres other departments that have work with and wed have have all their support well dont know three months two months would make happen but had the funds would try very hard make happen thats all could promise you there way ask the accreditation board for extension without funding tried that already fact went through that process november ask for extension and they basically said the extension would august september this year but had have provided all the information moving forward not would show accredibility moving forward just get them show january fly here crossed large hurdle get through that process question here chief you know the part their accreditation process they also look how you staff the department absolutely whats the three battalion chiefs the west side and molokai and all that was that part the yes and like taking away those positions would that affect accreditation yes guess the question for then ask the council you guys really want our department accredited not because you then you need staff correctly think thats the question asked mean you gotta put nuts and bolts them right because you say its only gonna cost two hundred thousand more dollars accredited mean what better standard have agree wonder theres way that could send letter` and have the commission chairs signature strongly voicing our opinion the accreditation process and what means finish was wondering how leverage this body into putting pressure the mayor and the chair county council take this seriously you guys might want put that out agenda item for next month and that way its every month that this goes one less month that he's got able just suggestion but would really you're gonna write that letter from this body you may want get more detailed solid information and numbers from the chief rather than some back the envelope calculations you wanted write one your own wouldnt suggest saying its from the body our power collected group its not individuals there was motion put the floor dont see your agenda page youll put the agenda would suggest that for such general purposes what can members can bump our next meeting date and time and can have request have item agendized can discuss the next meeting will work providing you with more hard numbers any more questions members just want say well done this really really really well done and think especially its not costing any money for the taxpayers moving forward this eyes its brainer job well done thank you thank you commissioner lepta any more questions members just one more just complement again what this document does really identifies being former member you know, you think you feel certain ways but here black and white and some color its really good document even for through and and see thank you will this document available public some point will put our website appreciate you bringing that because its really you know theres word thats being tossed around quite often transparency and think going through the accreditation process can not send that message stronger the people than transparency dont even understand how its not supported its extremely important for our community and our visitors know that theyre coming into accredited area and for want that takes lot work from all our members within the department wanting make that happen you know nobody wants somebody come their back yard and tell how for clean their yard but were willing see hey how can make better and goes for everything mean they came and helped with our ocean safety processes well they turned onto more information that realm once into the ninth edition all that has clear well right now they wouldve allowed move forward then have that work progress dont know how much that will cost thats added thing moving the ninth well but thank you very much for the discussion and the support hope that some point time that this can achieved for you well the community thank you for the opportunity all right quick announcement next meeting thursday june the fire prevention bureau the morning have that

like know both you guys have been many commissions before you kinda know the drill our chair has arrived relieved thank you vice chair youre time lets move item number six emergency management good morning you have front you our monthly report just few items had received our staff specialist three list and actually were able conduct interviews yesterday and were hoping make offer one the candidates that interviewed for that position well full staff that person takes the position far training and exercises finished our eoc basic training for our partners that was over about five week period where they were coming mondays that and now were moving into hurricane preparedness for community things there was zika tabletop exercise which seems little bit odd because the focus has kind moved away from zika but were getting into the season again where mosquitoes and high travel had that particular exercise the preparedness side our harp program continuing west maui theyve been very successful terms good turnout weve had lot repeat personnel werent sure the people would come each meeting every month but weve seen steady participation that and after this month which tropical cyclone they move away from hazard awareness into actual planning well see how many people start come out for the planning piece which more pencil the paper kind stuff ill just move down the response piece the emergent event guess well call that weve been involved the rat lung worm disease lot times people forget that also are participating with the department health during those types events really were just were not the lead that department health always remains the lead that but continue support terms coordination and especially with their messaging piece you have any questions the report happy take those otherwise ill move into the piece that commissioner john kyle asked about last week last month with the activation levels questions okay you have two handouts front you the first one nice bright color coded one our eoc activation levels used just have three but then fema and the national incident management system had recommended four tier which was very much similar what had just didnt have our day day operations there which level four you can see starts level four normal operations steady state thats today its blue because call blue sky day you know its just nice day were always monitoring for things that might happen with notice event the eoc not staffed that time the number three enhanced steady state something has come that maybe requires pay attention little bit more dont have the eoc staffed really that point but our standby person who call standby throughout the evening hours and off hours monitoring that actively looking notifications from the weather service whatever event might level two partial activation thats the most common thing that have after level three thats when have some our partners maybe event thats focused specific geographic area its not island county wide well have the emergency support functions who would affected that particular event and then level one activation full activation have all our county partners and state and other partners staffing all the emergency support functions anticipation something that know coming its happening occurring are speaking and the response and recoverys going require additional resources than just one two particular agencies the next page just made quick kind glance there are some events that automatically trigger certain activation level and thats what you see that chart there with tropical cyclone when the forecast advisories are issued again see that coming starts out with just our staff and maybe weve made notification for people who have something their day day operations that they would then escalates from watch warning youll see that activation level then scales two and one the one that most ill say difficult maybe difficults not the right word the one thats the most fluid probably flood scenario because flood watch will come out and itll maybe county wide and know theres potential for heavy rains etcetera and then when they issue advisory that means that heavy rains are occurring certain area and flooding may imminent but then when goes warning level its more than just nuisance flooding the advisory what they call nuisance flooding there will flooding and ponding the roads but its not getting into peoples homes its not endangering life much maybe properties but not higher level when warning our staff automatically goes into the eoc because during warning for flood goes from nothing something pretty quickly again weve already been contact with our partners they obviously know its raining outside but were monitoring the situation and just contact with our partners that call when for the standby eoc person call the other partners judgment call ill say and thats the one think that the most fluid far warning doesnt automatically bring the other partners and then things that are notice event like earthquake mass casualty they happen when they happen and then thats automatic eoc activation level charles did that answer your question yes answers lot questions but still have few questions sure now far districts and notification and actions they take lanai molokai lahaina now what point you recommend that they take action measures prepare for storm those are the same what here this island its county wide notification its the other ones like the flood again that its happening strictly specific district those are the ones that are little bit more challenging for but would recommend similar what have here and can talk still havent been able hire our part time person those districts but that person would the one that would staff and activate either themself with partners those eocs okay well guess what looking lets say storm coming and theres certain measures that district supervisors for the public works can take guess whats the trigger point for their activation recommendation from you the public works start preparing those would usually start happening watch level and those the eoc were not were recommending for the departments activate their own plan public works has their own triggers for that and they match with ours when call watch thats why too were always consultation with the weather service when theyre gonna make that call because does trigger actions departmental emergency plans there standard far measures that can taken once they get trigger point for example you know course molokai for example steven arcy used start filling his trucks start staging them critical areas there standard that you know that the public works takes yeah same thing okay both for tsunami and tropical cyclones watch triggers actions each those departments and basically standard plan every district supervisor has their own plan and are others aware that plan its standard plan department wide public works has their plan when into one these levels cant speak their personnel far how well they know their internal plan next question would far the utility companies that are very important whats your dialogue with them far their notifications cause they can take the same precautionary measures too that they you know theres points where water departments theyll shut down you know theyll lock down far dialogue with them where are you when does that happen sure the way have the eoc staffed now our operations section have three branches and one the branches infrastructure and the meco department water supply with the county the telephone company our public and private utilities are part infrastructure branch theyre called and theyre our call list okay they are yup theyre part our all the water departments all the private guys they all come not all the private water guys come they have liaison because dont have that much room when notify them they notify know theres some partnerships like maui yes yes okay they have representative that attends something they have one that represents private water yes thank you youre welcome travis would you interested that part time position know keep your eyes out when comes open had question goes back the rat lung worm disease huh there known hot spot the origin the disease itself here maui general general there place where the rats have the disease and thats why its coming out that area they know not that aware mean here its been weve been seeing obviously east maui but know the big island was linked cow heart and slug there right well that was just that particular incident but theyve had rat lung worm the big island for long time already and think when they started some more research theres been individual instances the other the other counties well but the key for again cause weve seen little bit panic with that particular disease where people are not buying local produce and just want stress that its not that you cannot buy the local produce comes down the consumers the farmers are doing what they can and then the intermediary doing what they can make sure that its clean and safe but consumer its also make sure that were washing and thats all takes washing properly doesnt even take you know those special things that theyre selling the store those sprays and things like that you take the time and wash your produce and its not just should tell folks all produce and thats kind the slogan that were working wash all produce all the time even says pre washed even its from the mainland cause they have other things their produce too sometimes its just habit that need retrain ourselves community wash all produce all the time any more questions thank you ann thank you let now move item number seven fire department aloha good morning members before you you have our monthly highlights for the month april okay does your team need any questions before move forward but any point time through each item you are welcome ask questions all right item the department highlights for motions and interviews you see there have gone through the process going through our recruit trainees did performance agility tests the end march and qualified some people for our openings that have currently have seventeen openings and will starting that class july first this year wanted march excuse may but did not have the funding move forward moves back the average recruit class lasts six and half months that pushes into january two thousand and eighteen our projected retirements are twenty for this year had five thus far anticipate fifteen more that might cause shortage issue going towards the end the year and thats something that try have discussions with council and the mayors office chief yes would you describe little bit more about what you said when you didnt have the funds okay you had delay the training class because you didnt have funds yes our department ran into shortage somewhere around november two thousand and sixteen and move forward move around funding from different programs make project til june came with short fall one point two million moving forward payroll and what have you those areas utilized overtime for our training instructors come and help with the process the recruit class and that was issue and topic and did not have the funding pay for the recruits during this fiscal year thats where the shortages are and have you thought about going back county council asking for special assessment did and sorry for pulling you into this provided the information for them and money was added our budget for this fiscal year handle but there was lengthy discussion about your million and half short roughly and what will that grow the end the fiscal year hopefully not much ask for budget amendment move forward the handle all those payroll issues and had the amendment believe its second reading not mistaken for next week and hopefully get that and nothing drastic happens between now and june but this our fifth year that weve gone for budget amendment let guess the first four didnt get theres question was gonna ask you the first four every year thus far this our fifth year that weve gone for budget amendment every year yeah every year weve gotten budget amendment for the shortage thank you chief youre welcome you said every year you had new budget every year its ranged from eighty thousand dollars two million dollars present our budget those are the things that into the process from the mayors office and then gets cut during the budget deliberations with council lot our projections are pretty close what need but then the cuts are made and have back through this process over and over again curious who you submit the request the chair budget chair yes the process goes through transmittal form which goes from the mayors office budget from budget the chair the council and then from the budget mean from the council chair the budget chair and then theyll either schedule not thank you youre welcome next question here sure chief you know when you have recruitment for classes how advertised online well the maui news and believe the star advertiser but doesnt into the molokai district cant answer that question you cant answer cause thats how molokai people dont know when the recruitments happen yeah that comes out our personal department but can pass that information can get that advertisement too commissioner notifications yeah kind doesnt necessarily through the fire department the department personnel services handles that you can ask for quest but its not something handled internally the department but ill ask cause mean think that would effective way get more molokai people apply because they just dont know about wonder our personnel services has notification list they you just put your name and now they have electronically individual can even theyre not looking for anybody provide their information that list and then when they send the list out the first mail out the newspaper then would come them the following monday usually goes out sunday and monday theyll get email blast long their email address information correct and updated guess you can let the newspapers molokai know that have people just sign thats good idea should pay for itself though man itd sure alleviate the non employment issue based that information that request will send that information department personnel services thank you members like welcome miss cher betas the meeting sorry all right moving from seven item number incident reports can look your handouts for the month april and you have any questions questions just noticed that what you call false alarms stays pretty consistent the amount yeah sure does yeah any questions members just one question about this false alarms are they from alarm companies are they from people actually pulling alarms its mix both believe spoke not sure was last month the month before but anytime have the alarm companies issue and its more than three times send them letter they usually get them pretty quick there anybody youre actually tracking whose constant repeat false alarm goes the car fire and hazard have one that separate ours passed before the police false alarm bill have process that can use after those individuals companies that have false alarms mean anything that you know you can reduce you know this cry wolf syndrome and lot times when get rash this its due bad weather electronically things dont run properly thats when youll see the influx and doesnt just happen but police department civil events and emergency management the big problem noticed when was working was alarms werent being serviced right and the batteries werent being replaced and when there was power outage youre supposed switch that battery thats backed but the batteries dead triggers the alarm think but they really need somebody really needs look ensuring that alarm companies service these alarms regular basis prevent this excessive response false alarms for the most part have excess six thousand commercial properties and all those have fire alarms were talking fifty out those six thousand that know think the ratio really good considering anything excessive reach out through our fire prevention bureau and through our inspection process that the checklist all times looked daily basis throughout our community hopefully that helps thank you youre welcome chief you made question the alarms all these commercial properties like multiples quick malls and all they all have lock boxes you know requirement from they start off new require them the lock box and majority them have that try not use that lesson yeah thats available any more questions okay item fire department two thousand fiscal year two thousand and eighteen budget updates which the three all right out our eighty three items that put forward through the mayors office only four those items made through council and then gonna talk little bit about some the cuts all right you know county wide funding where they try put most the equipment along with department public works and environmental management they put that fund for our ladder truck that cut four hundred thousand dollars from one point two million believe was eight hundred that doesnt get sufficient ladder truck but were the process putting that out bid and see where ends and then maybe going back ask for amendment for the bid that comes the winning bid have question chief sure you know when they make these cuts they consult with you guys experts their decision why theyre making the cuts when you guys know that something that you need smart thank you for that question that really good question the answer know they try research with other departments within hawaii what one the measuring points that they have really consider specifications what are the differences and what are different needs the other counties opposed ours were pretty clear what our needs are and not sure what the whole process about their decisions are but this not the first time that thats happened really puts the damper the whole process and the whole timing the contracts when they actually out thank you for that question the good news the two battalion chiefs that this commission well our administration has been fighting for has been put for limited term what that means were able hire the two people but theyll limited not permanent and the findings audit that they also approved that council will pay for whatever that findings come out will either make those positions permanent eliminate them completely not sure how that process gonna work still waiting the information for that but our department will full cooperation with that audit one the suggestions had was that the accreditation full blown audit the department and that was already paid for non profit which was much less cost wise but the council felt that they wanted something independently that was the decision that was made that they will fund that and well full cooperation with that chief what was the limitations the two positions based the findings the audit there wasnt two year term anything were not sure what the total time frame pending the audit the only thing that asked was that provide and fit the national fire protection agencies associations guidelines they accepted that fashion very comfortable doesnt matter who they hire when you anticipate the audit being complete have idea cause they havent chosen auditor auditor firm yet guess that would just disappointing you hire the two bodies got and the audit finishes six months later and then those bodies are adjusted there that possibility but going into that theyll fine for the fiscal year cause believe you have the funding for one year all positions are only for one year with active budget technically got the positions but dont have the funding for the positions have make adjustments for that well those are the kinds things thank you okay well didnt show our yeah but theyre funded thank you sorry ive just been corrected funded out the current budget yeah the loan the fyet budget which kicks july but they give positions mine okay that was good and thats awesome cause were under the assumption that cause didnt show our spreadsheet sir thank you all right and some the notable items that will need more funding moving forward our helicopter the new contracts came out and was slightly higher course you know the last contract was done four years ago annual cost basis that needs adjusted some point time there was discussion about eliminating our ocean safety battalion chief that got put back there well funding and whole thing was just wanted move from our admin program the ocean safety program could keep all that money and funding and personnel that same program couple minor adjustments were taking out our maintenance program they moved our four mechanics the operations program and still dont understand how and why that happened but the funding was maintained funding maintained which they just moved operations kind interesting process not sure what the whole thoughts were behind that but doesnt really affect and were gonna manage the same just clarification the board any questions all right having none moving forward the maui fire department standards covered accreditation report last month handed out folder that included those two reports and not sure anybody was able through that and may have some questions but what like over the first report which called the standards cover and that information compiled internally our people through dispatch and all our report management system all those data provided for you and this standards cover the data and information shows where need improve this the final report for that and covers every aspect our response and how our emergency areas that cover for all the districts youre gonna see some different response times different areas based the distances and the resources anybody has any questions the standards cover this quite robust document even its not this time you know let the chair know and ill able answer the questions for you lot work about year and half work went into this document and all part the accreditation process have question chief you know for that accreditation the response from the station the scene what the time part the crediting like twelve minutes its all dependent its all dependent for district and what provided the accreditation board for instance any city area its about sixteen minutes twelve sixteen minutes depending and thats for your first and second then like the say like cause theres big gap between paia and hana yes now would that fall under different category because its geographical yes falls under rural timeline and even those dont meet because our roadways and the distance just comment thought this was pretty awesome lot work you can see that lot work went into and you know being former member it's very impressive see all this work documenting that our department does and you know did you put team together put this yes you know for about seven years weve been asking for accreditation manager just one person and all know that that one person wouldnt able compile anything like this any point even they did that for twenty four hours day what did put team together and what call cadre system basically like instructors and what have you but put together team help with this accreditation process put teams for the standard cover put teams for the emergency response areas put teams for all those things some the over time that brought goes into that process did not pay the accreditation board anything other than pay for the travel the individuals coming out cause theyre non profit but they are the experts this area management believe that this process was very effective and efficient and they help provide these kinds documents for you thank your commissioner some time for that now any more questions the standards cover chief one quick question looking your response times again and looking for hana specifically and thirteen was twenty six minutes what page page fifty fifty five zero two thousand and thirteen the fire response was twenty six minutes and fifteen goes forty five minutes whats causing such dramatic change response time for hana okay how that works theyll take average the top ninety percent all responses during that annual year what that says that their distant response halts were further than the one the ninety percent that was done the year before but they still have factored theres way for you know manipulate the data the data what and have take that ninety percent all those calls that becomes your average for that year and glad that you picked that cause those are the things that the accreditation board looks our tour the island they saw the challenges that have and theyve given suggestions their report how manage that have question chief yes was wondering how many audits has this organization done with other fire departments thousands all them all them except for theyre the only body that does this internationally well the united states and only two hundred and forty two departments the united states are accredited out the ten thousand that are exist guess you were just unlucky that someone calls bad feelings call forward well absolutely yes had some calls that have been running five hours its really really interesting yeah when you take them tour then you take them around totally around the island they know that theres station kipahulu its really not its really good that through the data the statistics and really work out because our constituents need understand what are against and then this information helps provide what need budget well right like said our open arms that audit from third party and this was third party but well all over again its not issue for have nothing hide wanna learn more and want able provide that information much possible this information was provided each council member yes all right moving over the next report which the accreditation report this report you look the first page composed and written the four peer assessors that showed maui january and this the report they provided with the breakdown the areas that need work they also touch some the things that very well what page that accreditation report cover page the tab. look for the tab this one this report much more specific the needs and what our department needs work and focus because all the other core competencies were already met one the real issues have deadline for august this year and based our budgeting and what set forward that were not gonna make that deadline were hoping through this process provide the information and have the cadres work all the information that needs assessed and turned and then theyll come out and another assessment and our hopes are pass and accredited officially march but thats not gonna happen cause not have the funding put the teams together work these items were only eight items shy the total most departments through this process anyway the real issue here that invested lot money and time through this process self assessor and that was done the eighth edition starting january two thousand and eighteen all assessments done after that will have done the ninth edition theyll whole another process that have kind get all over again really was trying get this done august this year but its not gonna done when you say eighth edition ninth edition thats how many years that youve been working its the editions that the accreditation body comes out with they see times believe the eighth edition has been out approximately five six years and theyre making changes okay right they provided with window opportunity for three years get done and just were unable were gonna have start from scratch literally the next time through this process least your procedures directing there thats great theres lot positives that whole process right there sounds negative but theres lot positives that was learned through the process and were gonna continue press forward with these equipment right and that was one the areas that failed these our facilities because have real means managing maintenance our facilities where other departments have people that actually they have building maintenance repairs have none have fifteen facilities and have nobody take care them how many areas did you succeed and how many areas did you fail failed eight out out eighty six believe and those eighty six have met theres two hundred and sixty four other ones that met the majority those well but eight the core just did not meet eight out eighty six the chief this yeah thats pretty good the budget thats being worked right now the council for next year chief have question know you provided all the council people with the information here now with budget process sure they read this already couple times who less responsive the reason far council what does that mean whos the less responsive the needs the fire department the budget thats very subjective would recommend you wanted look into personally know would recommend you want look into personally but dont think the chief has opinion that probably have read the minutes that yes read the minutes and make your own conclusions thank you for the question chief just have one major concern the funding that you need complete the accreditation was supported the county administration yes see before started off this process went the classes understood what needed started front load the process with whatever funding had nine years ago and every year thus far and then two years ago had get the mayor sign off and support this has supported the process its just when gets the next level that its not supported youre pretty close know just like the police department you through review process internally where you kick around okay what need you know and then you put together and things get cut internally then goes the mayors office that things being cut but the final problem seems like just get over that hurdle need work little bit better with legislative portion get the funding that need yes thats good question just for clarification purposes accreditation basically audit the department and its whole operations prior that like said front loaded lot things and one the areas that did was our area certification for our needs and training for our department members that are snuff with and just try get the whole department whole all its policies and all its standing orders and standard operating guidelines the same process and hopefully one day we'll get the support needed youre just the feet yes being shiny not very far its extremely frustrating come this far the process and not being able finish feel you chief what dollar value are looking what what would the funding mechanism what would the dollars that you feel you need finish this out well initially would say six out the eight would come into some overtime which would probably about forty thousand dollars okay forty grand what else the other two would come into some processes and software and what have you for our records managing that are not sure what the total cost would but even estimated one hundred thousand dollars one hundred and fifty thousand dollars thats still reach for two hundred thousand dollars youd finish this project would say yes thats estimate yes once the program say you got the funding mutual funding for the program finish you know meeting the eight things that were not meeting right now has there been any discussion with council about should they decide adopt accreditation there big change pay for the department not all theres change pay all its saying that our department has met the standards accreditation which higher than minimum thats all were asking because want able provide the community with the best possible service and third party would say that the maui fire department cuts ratings that was goal this commission when got hired just trying carry what was asked within means chief have follow question were able somehow get the funding finish accreditation the timing still factor that would still huge factor because theres other departments that have work with and wed have have all their support well dont know three months two months would make happen but had the funds would try very hard make happen thats all could promise you there way ask the accreditation board for extension without funding tried that already fact went through that process november ask for extension and they basically said the extension would august september this year but had have provided all the information moving forward not would show accredibility moving forward just get them show january fly here crossed large hurdle get through that process question here chief you know the part their accreditation process they also look how you staff the department absolutely whats the three battalion chiefs the west side and molokai and all that was that part the yes and like taking away those positions would that affect accreditation yes guess the question for then ask the council you guys really want our department accredited not because you then you need staff correctly think thats the question asked mean you gotta put nuts and bolts them right because you say its only gonna cost two hundred thousand more dollars accredited mean what better standard have agree wonder theres way that could send letter` and have the commission chairs signature strongly voicing our opinion the accreditation process and what means finish was wondering how leverage this body into putting pressure the mayor and the chair county council take this seriously you guys might want put that out agenda item for next month and that way its every month that this goes one less month that he's got able just suggestion but would really you're gonna write that letter from this body you may want get more detailed solid information and numbers from the chief rather than some back the envelope calculations you wanted write one your own wouldnt suggest saying its from the body our power collected group its not individuals there was motion put the floor dont see your agenda page youll put the agenda would suggest that for such general purposes what can members can bump our next meeting date and time and can have request have item agendized can discuss the next meeting will work providing you with more hard numbers any more questions members just want say well done this really really really well done and think especially its not costing any money for the taxpayers moving forward this eyes its brainer job well done thank you thank you commissioner lepta any more questions members just one more just complement again what this document does really identifies being former member you know, you think you feel certain ways but here black and white and some color its really good document even for through and and see thank you will this document available public some point will put our website appreciate you bringing that because its really you know theres word thats being tossed around quite often transparency and think going through the accreditation process can not send that message stronger the people than transparency dont even understand how its not supported its extremely important for our community and our visitors know that theyre coming into accredited area and for want that takes lot work from all our members within the department wanting make that happen you know nobody wants somebody come their back yard and tell how for clean their yard but were willing see hey how can make better and goes for everything mean they came and helped with our ocean safety processes well they turned onto more information that realm once into the ninth edition all that has clear well right now they wouldve allowed move forward then have that work progress dont know how much that will cost thats added thing moving the ninth well but thank you very much for the discussion and the support hope that some point time that this can achieved for you well the community thank you for the opportunity all right quick announcement next meeting thursday june the fire prevention bureau the morning have that request add the agenda possible letter support for staff cover accreditation
