before but you have any questions thank your chair yeah dont know whos chair right now but just like know both you guys have been many commissions before you kinda know the drill our chair has arrived relieved thank you vice chair youre time lets move item number six emergency management good morning you have front you our monthly report just few items had received our staff specialist three list and actually were able conduct interviews yesterday and were hoping make offer one the candidates that interviewed for that position well full staff that person takes the position far training and exercises finished our eoc basic training for our partners that was over about five week period where they were coming mondays that and now were moving into hurricane preparedness for community things there was zika tabletop exercise which seems little bit odd because the focus has kind moved away from zika but were getting into the season again where mosquitoes and high travel had that particular exercise the preparedness side our harp program continuing west maui theyve been very successful terms good turnout weve had lot repeat personnel werent sure the people would come each meeting every month but weve seen steady participation that and after this month which tropical cyclone they move away from hazard awareness into actual planning well see how many people start come out for the planning piece which more pencil the paper kind stuff ill just move down the response piece the emergent event guess well call that weve been involved the rat lung worm disease lot times people forget that also are participating with the department health during those types events really were just were not the lead that department health always remains the lead that but continue support terms coordination and especially with their messaging piece you have any questions the report happy take those otherwise ill move into the piece that commissioner john kyle asked about last week last month with the activation levels questions okay you have two handouts front you the first one nice bright color coded one our eoc activation levels used just have three but then fema and the national incident management system had recommended four tier which was very much similar what had just didnt have our day day operations there which level four you can see starts level four normal operations steady state thats today its blue because call blue sky day you know its just nice day were always monitoring for things that might happen with notice event the eoc not staffed that time the number three enhanced steady state something has come that maybe requires pay attention little bit more dont have the eoc staffed really that point but our standby person who call standby throughout the evening hours and off hours monitoring that actively looking notifications from the weather service whatever event might level two partial activation thats the most common thing that have after level three thats when have some our partners maybe event thats focused specific geographic area its not island county wide well have the emergency support functions who would affected that particular event and then level one activation full activation have all our county partners and state and other partners staffing all the emergency support functions anticipation something that know coming its happening occurring are speaking and the response and recoverys going require additional resources than just one two particular agencies the next page just made quick kind glance there are some events that automatically trigger certain activation level and thats what you see that chart there with tropical cyclone when the forecast advisories are issued again see that coming starts out with just our staff and maybe weve made notification for people who have something their day day operations that they would then escalates from watch warning youll see that activation level then scales two and one the one that most ill say difficult maybe difficults not the right word the one thats the most fluid probably flood scenario because flood watch will come out and itll maybe county wide and know theres potential for heavy rains etcetera and then when they issue advisory that means that heavy rains are occurring certain area and flooding may imminent but then when goes warning level its more than just nuisance flooding the advisory what they call nuisance flooding there will flooding and ponding the roads but its not getting into peoples homes its not endangering life much maybe properties but not higher level when warning our staff automatically goes into the eoc because during warning for flood goes from nothing something pretty quickly again weve already been contact with our partners they obviously know its raining outside but were monitoring the situation and just contact with our partners that call when for the standby eoc person call the other partners judgment call ill say and thats the one think that the most fluid far warning doesnt automatically bring the other partners and then things that are notice event like earthquake mass casualty they happen when they happen and then thats automatic eoc activation level charles did that answer your question yes answers lot questions but still have few questions sure now far districts and notification and actions they take lanai molokai lahaina now what point you recommend that they take action measures prepare for storm those are the same what here this island its county wide notification its the other ones like the flood again that its happening strictly specific district those are the ones that are little bit more challenging for but would recommend similar what have here and can talk still havent been able hire our part time person those districts but that person would the one that would staff and activate either themself with partners those eocs okay well guess what looking lets say storm coming and theres certain measures that district supervisors for the public works can take guess whats the trigger point for their activation recommendation from you the public works start preparing those would usually start happening watch level and those the eoc were not were recommending for the departments activate their own plan public works has their own triggers for that and they match with ours when call watch thats why too were always consultation with the weather service when theyre gonna make that call because does trigger actions departmental emergency plans there standard far measures that can taken once they get trigger point for example you know course molokai for example steven arcy used start filling his trucks start staging them critical areas there standard that you know that the public works takes yeah same thing okay both for tsunami and tropical cyclones watch triggers actions each those departments and basically standard plan every district supervisor has their own plan and are others aware that plan its standard plan department wide public works has their plan when into one these levels cant speak their personnel far how well they know their internal plan next question would far the utility companies that are very important whats your dialogue with them far their notifications cause they can take the same precautionary measures too that they you know theres points where water departments theyll shut down you know theyll lock down far dialogue with them where are you when does that happen sure the way have the eoc staffed now our operations section have three branches and one the branches infrastructure and the meco department water supply with the county the telephone company our public and private utilities are part infrastructure branch theyre called and theyre our call list okay they are yup theyre part our all the water departments all the private guys they all come not all the private water guys come they have liaison because dont have that much room when notify them they notify know theres some partnerships like maui yes yes okay they have representative that attends something they have one that represents private water yes thank you youre welcome travis would you interested that part time position know keep your eyes out when comes open had question goes back the rat lung worm disease huh there known hot spot the origin the disease itself here maui general general there place where the rats have the disease and thats why its coming out that area they know not that aware mean here its been weve been seeing obviously east maui but know the big island was linked cow heart and slug there right well that was just that particular incident but theyve had rat lung worm the big island for long time already and think when they started some more research theres been individual instances the other the other counties well but the key for again cause weve seen little bit panic with that particular disease where people are not buying local produce and just want stress that its not that you cannot buy the local produce comes down the consumers the farmers are doing what they can and then the intermediary doing what they can make sure that its clean and safe but consumer its also make sure that were washing and thats all takes washing properly doesnt even take you know those special things that theyre selling the store those sprays and things like that you take the time and wash your produce and its not just should tell folks all produce and thats kind the slogan that were working wash all produce all the time even says pre washed even its from the mainland cause they have other things their produce too sometimes its just habit that need retrain ourselves community wash all produce all the time any more questions thank you ann thank you let now move item number seven fire department aloha good morning members before you you have our monthly highlights for the month april okay does your team need any questions before move forward but any point time through each item you are welcome ask questions all right item the department highlights for motions and interviews you see there have gone through the process going through our recruit trainees did performance agility tests the end march and qualified some people for our openings that have currently have seventeen openings and will starting that class july first this year wanted march excuse may but did not have the funding move forward moves back the average recruit class lasts six and half months that pushes into january two thousand and eighteen our projected retirements are twenty for this year had five thus far anticipate fifteen more that might cause shortage issue going towards the end the year and thats something that try have discussions with council and the mayors office chief yes would you describe little bit more about what you said when you didnt have the funds okay you had delay the training class because you didnt have funds yes our department ran into shortage somewhere around november two thousand and sixteen and move forward move around funding from different programs make project til june came with short fall one point two million moving forward payroll and what have you those areas utilized overtime for our training instructors come and help with the process the recruit class and that was issue and topic and did not have the funding pay for the recruits during this fiscal year thats where the shortages are and have you thought about going back county council asking for special assessment did and sorry for pulling you into this provided the information for them and money was added our budget for this fiscal year handle but there was lengthy discussion about your million and half short roughly and what will that grow the end the fiscal year hopefully not much ask for budget amendment move forward the handle all those payroll issues and had the amendment believe its second reading not mistaken for next week and hopefully get that and nothing drastic happens between now and june but this our fifth year that weve gone for budget amendment let guess the first four didnt get theres question was gonna ask you the first four every year thus far this our fifth year that weve gone for budget amendment every year yeah every year weve gotten budget amendment for the shortage thank you chief youre welcome you said every year you had new budget every year its ranged from eighty thousand dollars two million dollars present our budget those are the things that into the process from the mayors office and then gets cut during the budget deliberations with council lot our projections are pretty close what need but then the cuts are made and have back through this process over and over again curious who you submit the request the chair budget chair yes the process goes through transmittal form which goes from the mayors office budget from budget the chair the council and then from the budget mean from the council chair the budget chair and then theyll either schedule not thank you youre welcome next question here sure chief you know when you have recruitment for classes how advertised online well the maui news and believe the star advertiser but doesnt into the molokai district cant answer that question you cant answer cause thats how molokai people dont know when the recruitments happen yeah that comes out our personal department but can pass that information can get that advertisement too commissioner notifications yeah kind doesnt necessarily through the fire department the department personnel services handles that you can ask for quest but its not something handled internally the department but ill ask cause mean think that would effective way get more molokai people apply because they just dont know about wonder our personnel services has notification list they you just put your name and now they have electronically individual can even theyre not looking for anybody provide their information that list and then when they send the list out the first mail out the newspaper then would come them the following monday usually goes out sunday and monday theyll get email blast long their email address information correct and updated guess you can let the newspapers molokai know that have people just sign thats good idea should pay for itself though man itd sure alleviate the non employment issue based that information that request will send that information department personnel services thank you members like welcome miss cher betas the meeting sorry all right moving from seven item number incident reports can look your handouts for the month april and you have any questions questions just noticed that what you call false alarms stays pretty consistent the amount yeah sure does yeah any questions members just one question about this false alarms are they from alarm companies are they from people actually pulling alarms its mix both believe spoke not sure was last month the month before but anytime have the alarm companies issue and its more than three times send them letter they usually get them pretty quick there anybody youre actually tracking whose constant repeat false alarm goes the car fire and hazard have one that separate ours passed before the police false alarm bill have process that can use after those individuals companies that have false alarms mean anything that you know you can reduce you know this cry wolf syndrome and lot times when get rash this its due bad weather electronically things dont run properly thats when youll see the influx and doesnt just happen but police department civil events and emergency management the big problem noticed when was working was alarms werent being serviced right and the batteries werent being replaced and when there was power outage youre supposed switch that battery thats backed but the batteries dead triggers the alarm think but they really need somebody really needs look ensuring that alarm companies service these alarms regular basis prevent this excessive response false alarms for the most part have excess six thousand commercial properties and all those have fire alarms were talking fifty out those six thousand that know think the ratio really good considering anything excessive reach out through our fire prevention bureau and through our inspection process that the checklist all times looked daily basis throughout our community hopefully that helps thank you youre welcome chief you made question the alarms all these commercial properties like multiples quick malls and all they all have lock boxes you know requirement from they start off new require them the lock box and majority them have that try not use that lesson yeah thats available any more questions okay item fire department two thousand fiscal year two thousand and eighteen budget updates which the three all right out our eighty three items that put forward through the mayors office only four those items made through council and then gonna talk little bit about some the cuts all right you know county wide funding where they try put most the equipment along with department public works and environmental management they put that fund for our ladder truck that cut four hundred thousand dollars from one point two million believe was eight hundred that doesnt get sufficient ladder truck but were the process putting that out bid and see where ends and then maybe going back ask for amendment for the bid that comes the winning bid have question chief sure you know when they make these cuts they consult with you guys experts their decision why theyre making the cuts when you guys know that something that you need smart thank you for that question that really good question the answer know they try research with other departments within hawaii what one the measuring points that they have really consider specifications what are the differences and what are different needs the other counties opposed ours were pretty clear what our needs are and not sure what the whole process about their decisions are but this not the first time that thats happened really puts the damper the whole process and the whole timing the contracts when they actually out thank you for that question the good news the two battalion chiefs that this commission well our administration has been fighting for has been put for limited term what that means were able hire the two people but theyll limited not permanent and the findings audit that they also approved that council will pay for whatever that findings come out will either make those positions permanent eliminate them completely not sure how that process gonna work still waiting the information for that but our department will full cooperation with that audit one the suggestions had was that the accreditation full blown audit the department and that was already paid for non profit which was much less cost wise but the council felt that they wanted something independently that was the decision that was made that they will fund that and well full cooperation with that chief what was the limitations the two positions based the findings the audit there wasnt two year term anything were not sure what the total time frame pending the audit the only thing that asked was that provide and fit the national fire protection agencies associations guidelines they accepted that fashion very comfortable doesnt matter who they hire when you anticipate the audit being complete have idea cause they havent chosen auditor auditor firm yet guess that would just disappointing you hire the two bodies got and the audit finishes six months later and then those bodies are adjusted there that possibility but going into that theyll fine for the fiscal year cause believe you have the funding for one year all positions are only for one year with active budget technically got the positions but dont have the funding for the positions have make adjustments for that well those are the kinds things thank you okay well didnt show our yeah but theyre funded thank you sorry ive just been corrected funded out the current budget yeah the loan the fyet budget which kicks july but they give positions mine okay that was good and thats awesome cause were under the assumption that cause didnt show our spreadsheet sir thank you all right and some the notable items that will need more funding moving forward our helicopter the new contracts came out and was slightly higher course you know the last contract was done four years ago annual cost basis that needs adjusted some point time there was discussion about eliminating our ocean safety battalion chief that got put back there well funding and whole thing was just wanted move from our admin program the ocean safety program could keep all that money and funding and personnel that same program couple minor adjustments were taking out our maintenance program they moved our four mechanics the operations program and still dont understand how and why that happened but the funding was maintained funding maintained which they just moved operations kind interesting process not sure what the whole thoughts were behind that but doesnt really affect and were gonna manage the same just clarification the board any questions all right having none moving forward the maui fire department standards covered accreditation report last month handed out folder that included those two reports and not sure anybody was able through that and may have some questions but what like over the first report which called the standards cover and that information compiled internally our people through dispatch and all our report management system all those data provided for you and this standards cover the data and information shows where need improve this the final report for that and covers every aspect our response and how our emergency areas that cover for all the districts youre gonna see some different response times different areas based the distances and the resources anybody has any questions the standards cover this quite robust document even its not this time you know let the chair know and ill able answer the questions for you lot work about year and half work went into this document and all part the accreditation process have question chief you know for that accreditation the response from the station the scene what the time part the crediting like twelve minutes its all dependent its all dependent for district and what provided the accreditation board for instance any city area its about sixteen minutes twelve sixteen minutes depending and thats for your first and second then like the say like cause theres big gap between paia and hana yes now would that fall under different category because its geographical yes falls under rural timeline and even those dont meet because our roadways and the distance just comment thought this was pretty awesome lot work you can see that lot work went into and you know being former member it's very impressive see all this work documenting that our department does and you know did you put team together put this yes you know for about seven years weve been asking for accreditation manager just one person and all know that that one person wouldnt able compile anything like this any point even they did that for twenty four hours day what did put team together and what call cadre system basically like instructors and what have you but put together team help with this accreditation process put teams for the standard cover put teams for the emergency response areas put teams for all those things some the over time that brought goes into that process did not pay the accreditation board anything other than pay for the travel the individuals coming out cause theyre non profit but they are the experts this area management believe that this process was very effective and efficient and they help provide these kinds documents for you thank your commissioner some time for that now any more questions the standards cover chief one quick question looking your response times again and looking for hana specifically and thirteen was twenty six minutes what page page fifty fifty five zero two thousand and thirteen the fire response was twenty six minutes and fifteen goes forty five minutes whats causing such dramatic change response time for hana okay how that works theyll take average the top ninety percent all responses during that annual year what that says that their distant response halts were further than the one the ninety percent that was done the year before but they still have factored theres way for you know manipulate the data the data what and have take that ninety percent all those calls that becomes your average for that year and glad that you picked that cause those are the things that the accreditation board looks our tour the island they saw the challenges that have and theyve given suggestions their report how manage that have question chief yes was wondering how many audits has this organization done with other fire departments thousands all them all them except for theyre the only body that does this internationally well the united states and only two hundred and forty two departments the united states are accredited out the ten thousand that are exist guess you were just unlucky that someone calls bad feelings call forward well absolutely yes had some calls that have been running five hours its really really interesting yeah when you take them tour then you take them around totally around the island they know that theres station kipahulu its really not its really good that through the data the statistics and really work out because our constituents need understand what are against and then this information helps provide what need budget well right like said our open arms that audit from third party and this was third party but well all over again its not issue for have nothing hide wanna learn more and want able provide that information much possible this information was provided each council member yes all right moving over the next report which the accreditation report this report you look the first page composed and written the four peer assessors that showed maui january and this the report they provided with the breakdown the areas that need work they also touch some the things that very well what page that accreditation report cover page the tab. look for the tab this one this report much more specific the needs and what our department needs work and focus because all the other core competencies were already met one the real issues have deadline for august this year and based our budgeting and what set forward that were not gonna make that deadline were hoping through this process provide the information and have the cadres work all the information that needs assessed and turned and then theyll come out and another assessment and our hopes are pass and accredited officially march but thats not gonna happen cause not have the funding put the teams together work these items were only eight items shy the total most departments through this process anyway the real issue here that invested lot money and time through this process self assessor and that was done the eighth edition starting january two thousand and eighteen all assessments done after that will have done the ninth edition theyll whole another process that have kind get all over again really was trying get this done august this year but its not gonna done when you say eighth edition ninth edition thats how many years that youve been working its the editions that the accreditation body comes out with they see times believe the eighth edition has been out approximately five six years and theyre making changes okay right they provided with window opportunity for three years get done and just were unable were gonna have start from scratch literally the next time through this process least your procedures directing there thats great theres lot positives that whole process right there sounds negative but theres lot positives that was learned through the process and were gonna continue press forward with these equipment right and that was one the areas that failed these our facilities because have real means managing maintenance our facilities where other departments have people that actually they have building maintenance repairs have none have fifteen facilities and have nobody take care them how many areas did you succeed and how many areas did you fail failed eight out out eighty six believe and those eighty six have met theres two hundred and sixty four other ones that met the majority those well but eight the core just did not meet eight out eighty six the chief this yeah thats pretty good the budget thats being worked right now the council for next year chief have question know you provided all the council people with the information here now with budget process sure they read this already couple times who less responsive the reason far council what does that mean whos the less responsive the needs the fire department the budget thats very subjective would recommend you wanted look into personally know would recommend you want look into personally but dont think the chief has opinion that probably have read the minutes that yes read the minutes and make your own conclusions thank you for the question chief just have one major concern the funding that you need complete the accreditation was supported the county administration yes see before started off this process went the classes understood what needed started front load the process with whatever funding had nine years ago and every year thus far and then two years ago had get the mayor sign off and support this has supported the process its just when gets the next level that its not supported youre pretty close know just like the police department you through review process internally where you kick around okay what need you know and then you put together and things get cut internally then goes the mayors office that things being cut but the final problem seems like just get over that hurdle need work little bit better with legislative portion get the funding that need yes thats good question just for clarification purposes accreditation basically audit the department and its whole operations prior that like said front loaded lot things and one the areas that did was our area certification for our needs and training for our department members that are snuff with and just try get the whole department whole all its policies and all its standing orders and standard operating guidelines the same process and hopefully one day we'll get the support needed youre just the feet yes being shiny not very far its extremely frustrating come this far the process and not being able finish feel you chief what dollar value are looking what what would the funding mechanism what would the dollars that you feel you need finish this out well initially would say six out the eight would come into some overtime which would probably about forty thousand dollars okay forty grand what else the other two would come into some processes and software and what have you for our records managing that are not sure what the total cost would but even estimated one hundred thousand dollars one hundred and fifty thousand dollars thats still reach for two hundred thousand dollars youd finish this project would say yes thats estimate yes once the program say you got the funding mutual funding for the program finish you know meeting the eight things that were not meeting right now has there been any discussion with council about should they decide adopt accreditation there big change pay for the department not all theres change pay all its saying that our department has met the standards accreditation which higher than minimum thats all were asking because want able provide the community with the best possible service and third party would say that the maui fire department cuts ratings that was goal this commission when got hired just trying carry what was asked within means chief have follow question were able somehow get the funding finish accreditation the timing still factor that would still huge factor because theres other departments that have work with and wed have have all their support well dont know three months two months would make happen but had the funds would try very hard make happen thats all could promise you there way ask the accreditation board for extension without funding tried that already fact went through that process november ask for extension and they basically said the extension would august september this year but had have provided all the information moving forward not would show accredibility moving forward just get them show january fly here crossed large hurdle get through that process question here chief you know the part their accreditation process they also look how you staff the department absolutely whats the three battalion chiefs the west side and molokai and all that was that part the yes and like taking away those positions would that affect accreditation yes guess the question for then ask the council you guys really want our department accredited not because you then you need staff correctly think thats the question asked mean you gotta put nuts and bolts them right because you say its only gonna cost two hundred thousand more dollars accredited mean what better standard have agree wonder theres way that could send letter` and have the commission chairs signature strongly voicing our opinion the accreditation process and what means finish was wondering how leverage this body into putting pressure the mayor and the chair county council take this seriously you guys might want put that out agenda item for next month and that way its every month that this goes one less month that he's got able just suggestion but would really you're gonna write that letter from this body you may want get more detailed solid information and numbers from the chief rather than some back the envelope calculations you wanted write one your own wouldnt suggest saying its from the body our power collected group its not individuals there was motion put the floor dont see your agenda page youll put the agenda would suggest that for such general purposes what can members can bump our next meeting date and time and can have request have item agendized can discuss the next meeting will work providing you with more hard numbers any more questions members just want say well done this really really really well done and think especially its not costing any money for the taxpayers moving forward this eyes its brainer job well done thank you thank you commissioner lepta any more questions members just one more just complement again what this document does really identifies being former member you know, you think you feel certain ways but here black and white and some color its really good document even for through and and see thank you will this document available public some point will put our website appreciate you bringing that because its really you know theres word thats being tossed around quite often transparency and think going through the accreditation process can not send that message stronger the people than transparency dont even understand how its not supported its extremely important for our community and our visitors know that theyre coming into accredited area and for want that takes lot work from all our members within the department wanting make that happen you know nobody wants somebody come their back yard and tell how for clean their yard but were willing see hey how can make better and goes for everything mean they came and helped with our ocean safety processes well they turned onto more information that realm once into the ninth edition all that has clear well right now they wouldve allowed move forward then have that work progress dont know how much that will cost thats added thing moving the ninth well but thank you very much for the discussion and the support hope that some point time that this can achieved for you well the community thank you for the opportunity all right quick announcement next meeting

item number six emergency management good morning you have front you our monthly report just few items had received our staff specialist three list and actually were able conduct interviews yesterday and were hoping make offer one the candidates that interviewed for that position well full staff that person takes the position far training and exercises finished our eoc basic training for our partners that was over about five week period where they were coming mondays that and now were moving into hurricane preparedness for community things there was zika tabletop exercise which seems little bit odd because the focus has kind moved away from zika but were getting into the season again where mosquitoes and high travel had that particular exercise the preparedness side our harp program continuing west maui theyve been very successful terms good turnout weve had lot repeat personnel werent sure the people would come each meeting every month but weve seen steady participation that and after this month which tropical cyclone they move away from hazard awareness into actual planning well see how many people start come out for the planning piece which more pencil the paper kind stuff ill just move down the response piece the emergent event guess well call that weve been involved the rat lung worm disease lot times people forget that also are participating with the department health during those types events really were just were not the lead that department health always remains the lead that but continue support terms coordination and especially with their messaging piece you have any questions the report happy take those otherwise ill move into the piece that commissioner john kyle asked about last week last month with the activation levels questions okay you have two handouts front you the first one nice bright color coded one our eoc activation levels used just have three but then fema and the national incident management system had recommended four tier which was very much similar what had just didnt have our day day operations there which level four you can see starts level four normal operations steady state thats today its blue because call blue sky day you know its just nice day were always monitoring for things that might happen with notice event the eoc not staffed that time the number three enhanced steady state something has come that maybe requires pay attention little bit more dont have the eoc staffed really that point but our standby person who call standby throughout the evening hours and off hours monitoring that actively looking notifications from the weather service whatever event might level two partial activation thats the most common thing that have after level three thats when have some our partners maybe event thats focused specific geographic area its not island county wide well have the emergency support functions who would affected that particular event and then level one activation full activation have all our county partners and state and other partners staffing all the emergency support functions anticipation something that know coming its happening occurring are speaking and the response and recoverys going require additional resources than just one two particular agencies the next page just made quick kind glance there are some events that automatically trigger certain activation level and thats what you see that chart there with tropical cyclone when the forecast advisories are issued again see that coming starts out with just our staff and maybe weve made notification for people who have something their day day operations that they would then escalates from watch warning youll see that activation level then scales two and one the one that most ill say difficult maybe difficults not the right word the one thats the most fluid probably flood scenario because flood watch will come out and itll maybe county wide and know theres potential for heavy rains etcetera and then when they issue advisory that means that heavy rains are occurring certain area and flooding may imminent but then when goes warning level its more than just nuisance flooding the advisory what they call nuisance flooding there will flooding and ponding the roads but its not getting into peoples homes its not endangering life much maybe properties but not higher level when warning our staff automatically goes into the eoc because during warning for flood goes from nothing something pretty quickly again weve already been contact with our partners they obviously know its raining outside but were monitoring the situation and just contact with our partners that call when for the standby eoc person call the other partners judgment call ill say and thats the one think that the most fluid far warning doesnt automatically bring the other partners and then things that are notice event like earthquake mass casualty they happen when they happen and then thats automatic eoc activation level charles did that answer your question yes answers lot questions but still have few questions sure now far districts and notification and actions they take lanai molokai lahaina now what point you recommend that they take action measures prepare for storm those are the same what here this island its county wide notification its the other ones like the flood again that its happening strictly specific district those are the ones that are little bit more challenging for but would recommend similar what have here and can talk still havent been able hire our part time person those districts but that person would the one that would staff and activate either themself with partners those eocs okay well guess what looking lets say storm coming and theres certain measures that district supervisors for the public works can take guess whats the trigger point for their activation recommendation from you the public works start preparing those would usually start happening watch level and those the eoc were not were recommending for the departments activate their own plan public works has their own triggers for that and they match with ours when call watch thats why too were always consultation with the weather service when theyre gonna make that call because does trigger actions departmental emergency plans there standard far measures that can taken once they get trigger point for example you know course molokai for example steven arcy used start filling his trucks start staging them critical areas there standard that you know that the public works takes yeah same thing okay both for tsunami and tropical cyclones watch triggers actions each those departments and basically standard plan every district supervisor has their own plan and are others aware that plan its standard plan department wide public works has their plan when into one these levels cant speak their personnel far how well they know their internal plan next question would far the utility companies that are very important whats your dialogue with them far their notifications cause they can take the same precautionary measures too that they you know theres points where water departments theyll shut down you know theyll lock down far dialogue with them where are you when does that happen sure the way have the eoc staffed now our operations section have three branches and one the branches infrastructure and the meco department water supply with the county the telephone company our public and private utilities are part infrastructure branch theyre called and theyre our call list okay they are yup theyre part our all the water departments all the private guys they all come not all the private water guys come they have liaison because dont have that much room when notify them they notify know theres some partnerships like maui yes yes okay they have representative that attends something they have one that represents private water yes thank you youre welcome travis would you interested that part time position know keep your eyes out when comes open had question goes back the rat lung worm disease huh there known hot spot the origin the disease itself here maui general general there place where the rats have the disease and thats why its coming out that area they know not that aware mean here its been weve been seeing obviously east maui but know the big island was linked cow heart and slug there right well that was just that particular incident but theyve had rat lung worm the big island for long time already and think when they started some more research theres been individual instances the other the other counties well but the key for again cause weve seen little bit panic with that particular disease where people are not buying local produce and just want stress that its not that you cannot buy the local produce comes down the consumers the farmers are doing what they can and then the intermediary doing what they can make sure that its clean and safe but consumer its also make sure that were washing and thats all takes washing properly doesnt even take you know those special things that theyre selling the store those sprays and things like that you take the time and wash your produce and its not just should tell folks all produce and thats kind the slogan that were working wash all produce all the time even says pre washed even its from the mainland cause they have other things their produce too sometimes its just habit that need retrain ourselves community wash all produce all the time any more questions thank you ann thank you let now move item number seven fire department aloha good morning members before you you have our monthly highlights for the month april okay does your team need any questions before move forward but any point time through each item you are welcome ask questions all right item the department highlights for motions and interviews you see there have gone through the process going through our recruit trainees did performance agility tests the end march and qualified some people for our openings that have currently have seventeen openings and will starting that class july first this year wanted march excuse may but did not have the funding move forward moves back the average recruit class lasts six and half months that pushes into january two thousand and eighteen our projected retirements are twenty for this year had five thus far anticipate fifteen more that might cause shortage issue going towards the end the year and thats something that try have discussions with council and the mayors office chief yes would you describe little bit more about what you said when you didnt have the funds okay you had delay the training class because you didnt have funds yes our department ran into shortage somewhere around november two thousand and sixteen and move forward move around funding from different programs make project til june came with short fall one point two million moving forward payroll and what have you those areas utilized overtime for our training instructors come and help with the process the recruit class and that was issue and topic and did not have the funding pay for the recruits during this fiscal year thats where the shortages are and have you thought about going back county council asking for special assessment did and sorry for pulling you into this provided the information for them and money was added our budget for this fiscal year handle but there was lengthy discussion about your million and half short roughly and what will that grow the end the fiscal year hopefully not much ask for budget amendment move forward the handle all those payroll issues and had the amendment believe its second reading not mistaken for next week and hopefully get that and nothing drastic happens between now and june but this our fifth year that weve gone for budget amendment let guess the first four didnt get theres question was gonna ask you the first four every year thus far this our fifth year that weve gone for budget amendment every year yeah every year weve gotten budget amendment for the shortage thank you chief youre welcome you said every year you had new budget every year its ranged from eighty thousand dollars two million dollars present our budget those are the things that into the process from the mayors office and then gets cut during the budget deliberations with council lot our projections are pretty close what need but then the cuts are made and have back through this process over and over again curious who you submit the request the chair budget chair yes the process goes through transmittal form which goes from the mayors office budget from budget the chair the council and then from the budget mean from the council chair the budget chair and then theyll either schedule not thank you youre welcome next question here sure chief you know when you have recruitment for classes how advertised online well the maui news and believe the star advertiser but doesnt into the molokai district cant answer that question you cant answer cause thats how molokai people dont know when the recruitments happen yeah that comes out our personal department but can pass that information can get that advertisement too commissioner notifications yeah kind doesnt necessarily through the fire department the department personnel services handles that you can ask for quest but its not something handled internally the department but ill ask cause mean think that would effective way get more molokai people apply because they just dont know about wonder our personnel services has notification list they you just put your name and now they have electronically individual can even theyre not looking for anybody provide their information that list and then when they send the list out the first mail out the newspaper then would come them the following monday usually goes out sunday and monday theyll get email blast long their email address information correct and updated guess you can let the newspapers molokai know that have people just sign thats good idea should pay for itself though man itd sure alleviate the non employment issue based that information that request will send that information department personnel services thank you members like welcome miss cher betas the meeting sorry all right moving from seven item number incident reports can look your handouts for the month april and you have any questions questions just noticed that what you call false alarms stays pretty consistent the amount yeah sure does yeah any questions members just one question about this false alarms are they from alarm companies are they from people actually pulling alarms its mix both believe spoke not sure was last month the month before but anytime have the alarm companies issue and its more than three times send them letter they usually get them pretty quick there anybody youre actually tracking whose constant repeat false alarm goes the car fire and hazard have one that separate ours passed before the police false alarm bill have process that can use after those individuals companies that have false alarms mean anything that you know you can reduce you know this cry wolf syndrome and lot times when get rash this its due bad weather electronically things dont run properly thats when youll see the influx and doesnt just happen but police department civil events and emergency management the big problem noticed when was working was alarms werent being serviced right and the batteries werent being replaced and when there was power outage youre supposed switch that battery thats backed but the batteries dead triggers the alarm think but they really need somebody really needs look ensuring that alarm companies service these alarms regular basis prevent this excessive response false alarms for the most part have excess six thousand commercial properties and all those have fire alarms were talking fifty out those six thousand that know think the ratio really good considering anything excessive reach out through our fire prevention bureau and through our inspection process that the checklist all times looked daily basis throughout our community hopefully that helps thank you youre welcome chief you made question the alarms all these commercial properties like multiples quick malls and all they all have lock boxes you know requirement from they start off new require them the lock box and majority them have that try not use that lesson yeah thats available any more questions okay item fire department two thousand fiscal year two thousand and eighteen budget updates which the three all right out our eighty three items that put forward through the mayors office only four those items made through council and then gonna talk little bit about some the cuts all right you know county wide funding where they try put most the equipment along with department public works and environmental management they put that fund for our ladder truck that cut four hundred thousand dollars from one point two million believe was eight hundred that doesnt get sufficient ladder truck but were the process putting that out bid and see where ends and then maybe going back ask for amendment for the bid that comes the winning bid have question chief sure you know when they make these cuts they consult with you guys experts their decision why theyre making the cuts when you guys know that something that you need smart thank you for that question that really good question the answer know they try research with other departments within hawaii what one the measuring points that they have really consider specifications what are the differences and what are different needs the other counties opposed ours were pretty clear what our needs are and not sure what the whole process about their decisions are but this not the first time that thats happened really puts the damper the whole process and the whole timing the contracts when they actually out thank you for that question the good news the two battalion chiefs that this commission well our administration has been fighting for has been put for limited term what that means were able hire the two people but theyll limited not permanent and the findings audit that they also approved that council will pay for whatever that findings come out will either make those positions permanent eliminate them completely not sure how that process gonna work still waiting the information for that but our department will full cooperation with that audit one the suggestions had was that the accreditation full blown audit the department and that was already paid for non profit which was much less cost wise but the council felt that they wanted something independently that was the decision that was made that they will fund that and well full cooperation with that chief what was the limitations the two positions based the findings the audit there wasnt two year term anything were not sure what the total time frame pending the audit the only thing that asked was that provide and fit the national fire protection agencies associations guidelines they accepted that fashion very comfortable doesnt matter who they hire when you anticipate the audit being complete have idea cause they havent chosen auditor auditor firm yet guess that would just disappointing you hire the two bodies got and the audit finishes six months later and then those bodies are adjusted there that possibility but going into that theyll fine for the fiscal year cause believe you have the funding for one year all positions are only for one year with active budget technically got the positions but dont have the funding for the positions have make adjustments for that well those are the kinds things thank you okay well didnt show our yeah but theyre funded thank you sorry ive just been corrected funded out the current budget yeah the loan the fyet budget which kicks july but they give positions mine okay that was good and thats awesome cause were under the assumption that cause didnt show our spreadsheet sir thank you all right and some the notable items that will need more funding moving forward our helicopter the new contracts came out and was slightly higher course you know the last contract was done four years ago annual cost basis that needs adjusted some point time there was discussion about eliminating our ocean safety battalion chief that got put back there well funding and whole thing was just wanted move from our admin program the ocean safety program could keep all that money and funding and personnel that same program couple minor adjustments were taking out our maintenance program they moved our four mechanics the operations program and still dont understand how and why that happened but the funding was maintained funding maintained which they just moved operations kind interesting process not sure what the whole thoughts were behind that but doesnt really affect and were gonna manage the same just clarification the board any questions all right having none moving forward the maui fire department standards covered accreditation report last month handed out folder that included those two reports and not sure anybody was able through that and may have some questions but what like over the first report which called the standards cover and that information compiled internally our people through dispatch and all our report management system all those data provided for you and this standards cover the data and information shows where need improve this the final report for that and covers every aspect our response and how our emergency areas that cover for all the districts youre gonna see some different response times different areas based the distances and the resources anybody has any questions the standards cover this quite robust document even its not this time you know let the chair know and ill able answer the questions for you lot work about year and half work went into this document and all part the accreditation process have question chief you know for that accreditation the response from the station the scene what the time part the crediting like twelve minutes its all dependent its all dependent for district and what provided the accreditation board for instance any city area its about sixteen minutes twelve sixteen minutes depending and thats for your first and second then like the say like cause theres big gap between paia and hana yes now would that fall under different category because its geographical yes falls under rural timeline and even those dont meet because our roadways and the distance just comment thought this was pretty awesome lot work you can see that lot work went into and you know being former member it's very impressive see all this work documenting that our department does and you know did you put team together put this yes you know for about seven years weve been asking for accreditation manager just one person and all know that that one person wouldnt able compile anything like this any point even they did that for twenty four hours day what did put team together and what call cadre system basically like instructors and what have you but put together team help with this accreditation process put teams for the standard cover put teams for the emergency response areas put teams for all those things some the over time that brought goes into that process did not pay the accreditation board anything other than pay for the travel the individuals coming out cause theyre non profit but they are the experts this area management believe that this process was very effective and efficient and they help provide these kinds documents for you thank your commissioner some time for that now any more questions the standards cover chief one quick question looking your response times again and looking for hana specifically and thirteen was twenty six minutes what page page fifty fifty five zero two thousand and thirteen the fire response was twenty six minutes and fifteen goes forty five minutes whats causing such dramatic change response time for hana okay how that works theyll take average the top ninety percent all responses during that annual year what that says that their distant response halts were further than the one the ninety percent that was done the year before but they still have factored theres way for you know manipulate the data the data what and have take that ninety percent all those calls that becomes your average for that year and glad that you picked that cause those are the things that the accreditation board looks our tour the island they saw the challenges that have and theyve given suggestions their report how manage that have question chief yes was wondering how many audits has this organization done with other fire departments thousands all them all them except for theyre the only body that does this internationally well the united states and only two hundred and forty two departments the united states are accredited out the ten thousand that are exist guess you were just unlucky that someone calls bad feelings call forward well absolutely yes had some calls that have been running five hours its really really interesting yeah when you take them tour then you take them around totally around the island they know that theres station kipahulu its really not its really good that through the data the statistics and really work out because our constituents need understand what are against and then this information helps provide what need budget well right like said our open arms that audit from third party and this was third party but well all over again its not issue for have nothing hide wanna learn more and want able provide that information much possible this information was provided each council member yes all right moving over the next report which the accreditation report this report you look the first page composed and written the four peer assessors that showed maui january and this the report they provided with the breakdown the areas that need work they also touch some the things that very well what page that accreditation report cover page the tab. look for the tab this one this report much more specific the needs and what our department needs work and focus because all the other core competencies were already met one the real issues have deadline for august this year and based our budgeting and what set forward that were not gonna make that deadline were hoping through this process provide the information and have the cadres work all the information that needs assessed and turned and then theyll come out and another assessment and our hopes are pass and accredited officially march but thats not gonna happen cause not have the funding put the teams together work these items were only eight items shy the total most departments through this process anyway the real issue here that invested lot money and time through this process self assessor and that was done the eighth edition starting january two thousand and eighteen all assessments done after that will have done the ninth edition theyll whole another process that have kind get all over again really was trying get this done august this year but its not gonna done when you say eighth edition ninth edition thats how many years that youve been working its the editions that the accreditation body comes out with they see times believe the eighth edition has been out approximately five six years and theyre making changes okay right they provided with window opportunity for three years get done and just were unable were gonna have start from scratch literally the next time through this process least your procedures directing there thats great theres lot positives that whole process right there sounds negative but theres lot positives that was learned through the process and were gonna continue press forward with these equipment right and that was one the areas that failed these our facilities because have real means managing maintenance our facilities where other departments have people that actually they have building maintenance repairs have none have fifteen facilities and have nobody take care them how many areas did you succeed and how many areas did you fail failed eight out out eighty six believe and those eighty six have met theres two hundred and sixty four other ones that met the majority those well but eight the core just did not meet eight out eighty six the chief this yeah thats pretty good the budget thats being worked right now the council for next year chief have question know you provided all the council people with the information here now with budget process sure they read this already couple times who less responsive the reason far council what does that mean whos the less responsive the needs the fire department the budget thats very subjective would recommend you wanted look into personally know would recommend you want look into personally but dont think the chief has opinion that probably have read the minutes that yes read the minutes and make your own conclusions thank you for the question chief just have one major concern the funding that you need complete the accreditation was supported the county administration yes see before started off this process went the classes understood what needed started front load the process with whatever funding had nine years ago and every year thus far and then two years ago had get the mayor sign off and support this has supported the process its just when gets the next level that its not supported youre pretty close know just like the police department you through review process internally where you kick around okay what need you know and then you put together and things get cut internally then goes the mayors office that things being cut but the final problem seems like just get over that hurdle need work little bit better with legislative portion get the funding that need yes thats good question just for clarification purposes accreditation basically audit the department and its whole operations prior that like said front loaded lot things and one the areas that did was our area certification for our needs and training for our department members that are snuff with and just try get the whole department whole all its policies and all its standing orders and standard operating guidelines the same process and hopefully one day we'll get the support needed youre just the feet yes being shiny not very far its extremely frustrating come this far the process and not being able finish feel you chief what dollar value are looking what what would the funding mechanism what would the dollars that you feel you need finish this out well initially would say six out the eight would come into some overtime which would probably about forty thousand dollars okay forty grand what else the other two would come into some processes and software and what have you for our records managing that are not sure what the total cost would but even estimated one hundred thousand dollars one hundred and fifty thousand dollars thats still reach for two hundred thousand dollars youd finish this project would say yes thats estimate yes once the program say you got the funding mutual funding for the program finish you know meeting the eight things that were not meeting right now has there been any discussion with council about should they decide adopt accreditation there big change pay for the department not all theres change pay all its saying that our department has met the standards accreditation which higher than minimum thats all were asking because want able provide the community with the best possible service and third party would say that the maui fire department cuts ratings that was goal this commission when got hired just trying carry what was asked within means chief have follow question were able somehow get the funding finish accreditation the timing still factor that would still huge factor because theres other departments that have work with and wed have have all their support well dont know three months two months would make happen but had the funds would try very hard make happen thats all could promise you there way ask the accreditation board for extension without funding tried that already fact went through that process november ask for extension and they basically said the extension would august september this year but had have provided all the information moving forward not would show accredibility moving forward just get them show january fly here crossed large hurdle get through that process question here chief you know the part their accreditation process they also look how you staff the department absolutely whats the three battalion chiefs the west side and molokai and all that was that part the yes and like taking away those positions would that affect accreditation yes guess the question for then ask the council you guys really want our department accredited not because you then you need staff correctly think thats the question asked mean you gotta put nuts and bolts them right because you say its only gonna cost two hundred thousand more dollars accredited mean what better standard have agree wonder theres way that could send letter` and have the commission chairs signature strongly voicing our opinion the accreditation process and what means finish was wondering how leverage this body into putting pressure the mayor and the chair county council take this seriously you guys might want put that out agenda item for next month and that way its every month that this goes one less month that he's got able just suggestion but would really you're gonna write that letter from this body you may want get more detailed solid information and numbers from the chief rather than some back the envelope calculations you wanted write one your own wouldnt suggest saying its from the body our power collected group its not individuals there was motion put the floor dont see your agenda page youll put the agenda would suggest that for such general purposes what can members can bump our next meeting date and time and can have request have item agendized can discuss the next meeting will work providing you with more hard numbers any more questions members just want say well done this really really really well done and think especially its not costing any money for the taxpayers moving forward this eyes its brainer job well done thank you thank you commissioner lepta any more questions members just one more just complement again what this document does really identifies being former member you know, you think you feel certain ways but here black and white and some color its really good document even for through and and see thank you will this document available public some point will put our website appreciate you bringing that because its really you know theres word thats being tossed around quite often transparency and think going through the accreditation process can not send that message stronger the people than transparency dont even understand how its not supported its extremely important for our community and our visitors know that theyre coming into accredited area and for want that takes lot work from all our members within the department wanting make that happen you know nobody wants somebody come their back yard and tell how for clean their yard but were willing see hey how can make better and goes for everything mean they came and helped with our ocean safety processes well they turned onto more information that realm once into the ninth edition all that has clear well right now they wouldve allowed move forward then have that work progress dont know how much that will cost thats added thing moving the ninth well but thank you very much for the discussion and the support hope that some point time that this can achieved for you well the community thank you for the opportunity all right quick announcement next meeting thursday june the fire prevention bureau the morning have that

like know both you guys have been many commissions before you kinda know the drill our chair has arrived relieved thank you vice chair youre time lets move item number six emergency management good morning you have front you our monthly report just few items had received our staff specialist three list and actually were able conduct interviews yesterday and were hoping make offer one the candidates that interviewed for that position well full staff that person takes the position far training and exercises finished our eoc basic training for our partners that was over about five week period where they were coming mondays that and now were moving into hurricane preparedness for community things there was zika tabletop exercise which seems little bit odd because the focus has kind moved away from zika but were getting into the season again where mosquitoes and high travel had that particular exercise the preparedness side our harp program continuing west maui theyve been very successful terms good turnout weve had lot repeat personnel werent sure the people would come each meeting every month but weve seen steady participation that and after this month which tropical cyclone they move away from hazard awareness into actual planning well see how many people start come out for the planning piece which more pencil the paper kind stuff ill just move down the response piece the emergent event guess well call that weve been involved the rat lung worm disease lot times people forget that also are participating with the department health during those types events really were just were not the lead that department health always remains the lead that but continue support terms coordination and especially with their messaging piece you have any questions the report happy take those otherwise ill move into the piece that commissioner john kyle asked about last week last month with the activation levels questions okay you have two handouts front you the first one nice bright color coded one our eoc activation levels used just have three but then fema and the national incident management system had recommended four tier which was very much similar what had just didnt have our day day operations there which level four you can see starts level four normal operations steady state thats today its blue because call blue sky day you know its just nice day were always monitoring for things that might happen with notice event the eoc not staffed that time the number three enhanced steady state something has come that maybe requires pay attention little bit more dont have the eoc staffed really that point but our standby person who call standby throughout the evening hours and off hours monitoring that actively looking notifications from the weather service whatever event might level two partial activation thats the most common thing that have after level three thats when have some our partners maybe event thats focused specific geographic area its not island county wide well have the emergency support functions who would affected that particular event and then level one activation full activation have all our county partners and state and other partners staffing all the emergency support functions anticipation something that know coming its happening occurring are speaking and the response and recoverys going require additional resources than just one two particular agencies the next page just made quick kind glance there are some events that automatically trigger certain activation level and thats what you see that chart there with tropical cyclone when the forecast advisories are issued again see that coming starts out with just our staff and maybe weve made notification for people who have something their day day operations that they would then escalates from watch warning youll see that activation level then scales two and one the one that most ill say difficult maybe difficults not the right word the one thats the most fluid probably flood scenario because flood watch will come out and itll maybe county wide and know theres potential for heavy rains etcetera and then when they issue advisory that means that heavy rains are occurring certain area and flooding may imminent but then when goes warning level its more than just nuisance flooding the advisory what they call nuisance flooding there will flooding and ponding the roads but its not getting into peoples homes its not endangering life much maybe properties but not higher level when warning our staff automatically goes into the eoc because during warning for flood goes from nothing something pretty quickly again weve already been contact with our partners they obviously know its raining outside but were monitoring the situation and just contact with our partners that call when for the standby eoc person call the other partners judgment call ill say and thats the one think that the most fluid far warning doesnt automatically bring the other partners and then things that are notice event like earthquake mass casualty they happen when they happen and then thats automatic eoc activation level charles did that answer your question yes answers lot questions but still have few questions sure now far districts and notification and actions they take lanai molokai lahaina now what point you recommend that they take action measures prepare for storm those are the same what here this island its county wide notification its the other ones like the flood again that its happening strictly specific district those are the ones that are little bit more challenging for but would recommend similar what have here and can talk still havent been able hire our part time person those districts but that person would the one that would staff and activate either themself with partners those eocs okay well guess what looking lets say storm coming and theres certain measures that district supervisors for the public works can take guess whats the trigger point for their activation recommendation from you the public works start preparing those would usually start happening watch level and those the eoc were not were recommending for the departments activate their own plan public works has their own triggers for that and they match with ours when call watch thats why too were always consultation with the weather service when theyre gonna make that call because does trigger actions departmental emergency plans there standard far measures that can taken once they get trigger point for example you know course molokai for example steven arcy used start filling his trucks start staging them critical areas there standard that you know that the public works takes yeah same thing okay both for tsunami and tropical cyclones watch triggers actions each those departments and basically standard plan every district supervisor has their own plan and are others aware that plan its standard plan department wide public works has their plan when into one these levels cant speak their personnel far how well they know their internal plan next question would far the utility companies that are very important whats your dialogue with them far their notifications cause they can take the same precautionary measures too that they you know theres points where water departments theyll shut down you know theyll lock down far dialogue with them where are you when does that happen sure the way have the eoc staffed now our operations section have three branches and one the branches infrastructure and the meco department water supply with the county the telephone company our public and private utilities are part infrastructure branch theyre called and theyre our call list okay they are yup theyre part our all the water departments all the private guys they all come not all the private water guys come they have liaison because dont have that much room when notify them they notify know theres some partnerships like maui yes yes okay they have representative that attends something they have one that represents private water yes thank you youre welcome travis would you interested that part time position know keep your eyes out when comes open had question goes back the rat lung worm disease huh there known hot spot the origin the disease itself here maui general general there place where the rats have the disease and thats why its coming out that area they know not that aware mean here its been weve been seeing obviously east maui but know the big island was linked cow heart and slug there right well that was just that particular incident but theyve had rat lung worm the big island for long time already and think when they started some more research theres been individual instances the other the other counties well but the key for again cause weve seen little bit panic with that particular disease where people are not buying local produce and just want stress that its not that you cannot buy the local produce comes down the consumers the farmers are doing what they can and then the intermediary doing what they can make sure that its clean and safe but consumer its also make sure that were washing and thats all takes washing properly doesnt even take you know those special things that theyre selling the store those sprays and things like that you take the time and wash your produce and its not just should tell folks all produce and thats kind the slogan that were working wash all produce all the time even says pre washed even its from the mainland cause they have other things their produce too sometimes its just habit that need retrain ourselves community wash all produce all the time any more questions thank you ann thank you let now move item number seven fire department aloha good morning members before you you have our monthly highlights for the month april okay does your team need any questions before move forward but any point time through each item you are welcome ask questions all right item the department highlights for motions and interviews you see there have gone through the process going through our recruit trainees did performance agility tests the end march and qualified some people for our openings that have currently have seventeen openings and will starting that class july first this year wanted march excuse may but did not have the funding move forward moves back the average recruit class lasts six and half months that pushes into january two thousand and eighteen our projected retirements are twenty for this year had five thus far anticipate fifteen more that might cause shortage issue going towards the end the year and thats something that try have discussions with council and the mayors office chief yes would you describe little bit more about what you said when you didnt have the funds okay you had delay the training class because you didnt have funds yes our department ran into shortage somewhere around november two thousand and sixteen and move forward move around funding from different programs make project til june came with short fall one point two million moving forward payroll and what have you those areas utilized overtime for our training instructors come and help with the process the recruit class and that was issue and topic and did not have the funding pay for the recruits during this fiscal year thats where the shortages are and have you thought about going back county council asking for special assessment did and sorry for pulling you into this provided the information for them and money was added our budget for this fiscal year handle but there was lengthy discussion about your million and half short roughly and what will that grow the end the fiscal year hopefully not much ask for budget amendment move forward the handle all those payroll issues and had the amendment believe its second reading not mistaken for next week and hopefully get that and nothing drastic happens between now and june but this our fifth year that weve gone for budget amendment let guess the first four didnt get theres question was gonna ask you the first four every year thus far this our fifth year that weve gone for budget amendment every year yeah every year weve gotten budget amendment for the shortage thank you chief youre welcome you said every year you had new budget every year its ranged from eighty thousand dollars two million dollars present our budget those are the things that into the process from the mayors office and then gets cut during the budget deliberations with council lot our projections are pretty close what need but then the cuts are made and have back through this process over and over again curious who you submit the request the chair budget chair yes the process goes through transmittal form which goes from the mayors office budget from budget the chair the council and then from the budget mean from the council chair the budget chair and then theyll either schedule not thank you youre welcome next question here sure chief you know when you have recruitment for classes how advertised online well the maui news and believe the star advertiser but doesnt into the molokai district cant answer that question you cant answer cause thats how molokai people dont know when the recruitments happen yeah that comes out our personal department but can pass that information can get that advertisement too commissioner notifications yeah kind doesnt necessarily through the fire department the department personnel services handles that you can ask for quest but its not something handled internally the department but ill ask cause mean think that would effective way get more molokai people apply because they just dont know about wonder our personnel services has notification list they you just put your name and now they have electronically individual can even theyre not looking for anybody provide their information that list and then when they send the list out the first mail out the newspaper then would come them the following monday usually goes out sunday and monday theyll get email blast long their email address information correct and updated guess you can let the newspapers molokai know that have people just sign thats good idea should pay for itself though man itd sure alleviate the non employment issue based that information that request will send that information department personnel services thank you members like welcome miss cher betas the meeting sorry all right moving from seven item number incident reports can look your handouts for the month april and you have any questions questions just noticed that what you call false alarms stays pretty consistent the amount yeah sure does yeah any questions members just one question about this false alarms are they from alarm companies are they from people actually pulling alarms its mix both believe spoke not sure was last month the month before but anytime have the alarm companies issue and its more than three times send them letter they usually get them pretty quick there anybody youre actually tracking whose constant repeat false alarm goes the car fire and hazard have one that separate ours passed before the police false alarm bill have process that can use after those individuals companies that have false alarms mean anything that you know you can reduce you know this cry wolf syndrome and lot times when get rash this its due bad weather electronically things dont run properly thats when youll see the influx and doesnt just happen but police department civil events and emergency management the big problem noticed when was working was alarms werent being serviced right and the batteries werent being replaced and when there was power outage youre supposed switch that battery thats backed but the batteries dead triggers the alarm think but they really need somebody really needs look ensuring that alarm companies service these alarms regular basis prevent this excessive response false alarms for the most part have excess six thousand commercial properties and all those have fire alarms were talking fifty out those six thousand that know think the ratio really good considering anything excessive reach out through our fire prevention bureau and through our inspection process that the checklist all times looked daily basis throughout our community hopefully that helps thank you youre welcome chief you made question the alarms all these commercial properties like multiples quick malls and all they all have lock boxes you know requirement from they start off new require them the lock box and majority them have that try not use that lesson yeah thats available any more questions okay item fire department two thousand fiscal year two thousand and eighteen budget updates which the three all right out our eighty three items that put forward through the mayors office only four those items made through council and then gonna talk little bit about some the cuts all right you know county wide funding where they try put most the equipment along with department public works and environmental management they put that fund for our ladder truck that cut four hundred thousand dollars from one point two million believe was eight hundred that doesnt get sufficient ladder truck but were the process putting that out bid and see where ends and then maybe going back ask for amendment for the bid that comes the winning bid have question chief sure you know when they make these cuts they consult with you guys experts their decision why theyre making the cuts when you guys know that something that you need smart thank you for that question that really good question the answer know they try research with other departments within hawaii what one the measuring points that they have really consider specifications what are the differences and what are different needs the other counties opposed ours were pretty clear what our needs are and not sure what the whole process about their decisions are but this not the first time that thats happened really puts the damper the whole process and the whole timing the contracts when they actually out thank you for that question the good news the two battalion chiefs that this commission well our administration has been fighting for has been put for limited term what that means were able hire the two people but theyll limited not permanent and the findings audit that they also approved that council will pay for whatever that findings come out will either make those positions permanent eliminate them completely not sure how that process gonna work still waiting the information for that but our department will full cooperation with that audit one the suggestions had was that the accreditation full blown audit the department and that was already paid for non profit which was much less cost wise but the council felt that they wanted something independently that was the decision that was made that they will fund that and well full cooperation with that chief what was the limitations the two positions based the findings the audit there wasnt two year term anything were not sure what the total time frame pending the audit the only thing that asked was that provide and fit the national fire protection agencies associations guidelines they accepted that fashion very comfortable doesnt matter who they hire when you anticipate the audit being complete have idea cause they havent chosen auditor auditor firm yet guess that would just disappointing you hire the two bodies got and the audit finishes six months later and then those bodies are adjusted there that possibility but going into that theyll fine for the fiscal year cause believe you have the funding for one year all positions are only for one year with active budget technically got the positions but dont have the funding for the positions have make adjustments for that well those are the kinds things thank you okay well didnt show our yeah but theyre funded thank you sorry ive just been corrected funded out the current budget yeah the loan the fyet budget which kicks july but they give positions mine okay that was good and thats awesome cause were under the assumption that cause didnt show our spreadsheet sir thank you all right and some the notable items that will need more funding moving forward our helicopter the new contracts came out and was slightly higher course you know the last contract was done four years ago annual cost basis that needs adjusted some point time there was discussion about eliminating our ocean safety battalion chief that got put back there well funding and whole thing was just wanted move from our admin program the ocean safety program could keep all that money and funding and personnel that same program couple minor adjustments were taking out our maintenance program they moved our four mechanics the operations program and still dont understand how and why that happened but the funding was maintained funding maintained which they just moved operations kind interesting process not sure what the whole thoughts were behind that but doesnt really affect and were gonna manage the same just clarification the board any questions all right having none moving forward the maui fire department standards covered accreditation report last month handed out folder that included those two reports and not sure anybody was able through that and may have some questions but what like over the first report which called the standards cover and that information compiled internally our people through dispatch and all our report management system all those data provided for you and this standards cover the data and information shows where need improve this the final report for that and covers every aspect our response and how our emergency areas that cover for all the districts youre gonna see some different response times different areas based the distances and the resources anybody has any questions the standards cover this quite robust document even its not this time you know let the chair know and ill able answer the questions for you lot work about year and half work went into this document and all part the accreditation process have question chief you know for that accreditation the response from the station the scene what the time part the crediting like twelve minutes its all dependent its all dependent for district and what provided the accreditation board for instance any city area its about sixteen minutes twelve sixteen minutes depending and thats for your first and second then like the say like cause theres big gap between paia and hana yes now would that fall under different category because its geographical yes falls under rural timeline and even those dont meet because our roadways and the distance just comment thought this was pretty awesome lot work you can see that lot work went into and you know being former member it's very impressive see all this work documenting that our department does and you know did you put team together put this yes you know for about seven years weve been asking for accreditation manager just one person and all know that that one person wouldnt able compile anything like this any point even they did that for twenty four hours day what did put team together and what call cadre system basically like instructors and what have you but put together team help with this accreditation process put teams for the standard cover put teams for the emergency response areas put teams for all those things some the over time that brought goes into that process did not pay the accreditation board anything other than pay for the travel the individuals coming out cause theyre non profit but they are the experts this area management believe that this process was very effective and efficient and they help provide these kinds documents for you thank your commissioner some time for that now any more questions the standards cover chief one quick question looking your response times again and looking for hana specifically and thirteen was twenty six minutes what page page fifty fifty five zero two thousand and thirteen the fire response was twenty six minutes and fifteen goes forty five minutes whats causing such dramatic change response time for hana okay how that works theyll take average the top ninety percent all responses during that annual year what that says that their distant response halts were further than the one the ninety percent that was done the year before but they still have factored theres way for you know manipulate the data the data what and have take that ninety percent all those calls that becomes your average for that year and glad that you picked that cause those are the things that the accreditation board looks our tour the island they saw the challenges that have and theyve given suggestions their report how manage that have question chief yes was wondering how many audits has this organization done with other fire departments thousands all them all them except for theyre the only body that does this internationally well the united states and only two hundred and forty two departments the united states are accredited out the ten thousand that are exist guess you were just unlucky that someone calls bad feelings call forward well absolutely yes had some calls that have been running five hours its really really interesting yeah when you take them tour then you take them around totally around the island they know that theres station kipahulu its really not its really good that through the data the statistics and really work out because our constituents need understand what are against and then this information helps provide what need budget well right like said our open arms that audit from third party and this was third party but well all over again its not issue for have nothing hide wanna learn more and want able provide that information much possible this information was provided each council member yes all right moving over the next report which the accreditation report this report you look the first page composed and written the four peer assessors that showed maui january and this the report they provided with the breakdown the areas that need work they also touch some the things that very well what page that accreditation report cover page the tab. look for the tab this one this report much more specific the needs and what our department needs work and focus because all the other core competencies were already met one the real issues have deadline for august this year and based our budgeting and what set forward that were not gonna make that deadline were hoping through this process provide the information and have the cadres work all the information that needs assessed and turned and then theyll come out and another assessment and our hopes are pass and accredited officially march but thats not gonna happen cause not have the funding put the teams together work these items were only eight items shy the total most departments through this process anyway the real issue here that invested lot money and time through this process self assessor and that was done the eighth edition starting january two thousand and eighteen all assessments done after that will have done the ninth edition theyll whole another process that have kind get all over again really was trying get this done august this year but its not gonna done when you say eighth edition ninth edition thats how many years that youve been working its the editions that the accreditation body comes out with they see times believe the eighth edition has been out approximately five six years and theyre making changes okay right they provided with window opportunity for three years get done and just were unable were gonna have start from scratch literally the next time through this process least your procedures directing there thats great theres lot positives that whole process right there sounds negative but theres lot positives that was learned through the process and were gonna continue press forward with these equipment right and that was one the areas that failed these our facilities because have real means managing maintenance our facilities where other departments have people that actually they have building maintenance repairs have none have fifteen facilities and have nobody take care them how many areas did you succeed and how many areas did you fail failed eight out out eighty six believe and those eighty six have met theres two hundred and sixty four other ones that met the majority those well but eight the core just did not meet eight out eighty six the chief this yeah thats pretty good the budget thats being worked right now the council for next year chief have question know you provided all the council people with the information here now with budget process sure they read this already couple times who less responsive the reason far council what does that mean whos the less responsive the needs the fire department the budget thats very subjective would recommend you wanted look into personally know would recommend you want look into personally but dont think the chief has opinion that probably have read the minutes that yes read the minutes and make your own conclusions thank you for the question chief just have one major concern the funding that you need complete the accreditation was supported the county administration yes see before started off this process went the classes understood what needed started front load the process with whatever funding had nine years ago and every year thus far and then two years ago had get the mayor sign off and support this has supported the process its just when gets the next level that its not supported youre pretty close know just like the police department you through review process internally where you kick around okay what need you know and then you put together and things get cut internally then goes the mayors office that things being cut but the final problem seems like just get over that hurdle need work little bit better with legislative portion get the funding that need yes thats good question just for clarification purposes accreditation basically audit the department and its whole operations prior that like said front loaded lot things and one the areas that did was our area certification for our needs and training for our department members that are snuff with and just try get the whole department whole all its policies and all its standing orders and standard operating guidelines the same process and hopefully one day we'll get the support needed youre just the feet yes being shiny not very far its extremely frustrating come this far the process and not being able finish feel you chief what dollar value are looking what what would the funding mechanism what would the dollars that you feel you need finish this out well initially would say six out the eight would come into some overtime which would probably about forty thousand dollars okay forty grand what else the other two would come into some processes and software and what have you for our records managing that are not sure what the total cost would but even estimated one hundred thousand dollars one hundred and fifty thousand dollars thats still reach for two hundred thousand dollars youd finish this project would say yes thats estimate yes once the program say you got the funding mutual funding for the program finish you know meeting the eight things that were not meeting right now has there been any discussion with council about should they decide adopt accreditation there big change pay for the department not all theres change pay all its saying that our department has met the standards accreditation which higher than minimum thats all were asking because want able provide the community with the best possible service and third party would say that the maui fire department cuts ratings that was goal this commission when got hired just trying carry what was asked within means chief have follow question were able somehow get the funding finish accreditation the timing still factor that would still huge factor because theres other departments that have work with and wed have have all their support well dont know three months two months would make happen but had the funds would try very hard make happen thats all could promise you there way ask the accreditation board for extension without funding tried that already fact went through that process november ask for extension and they basically said the extension would august september this year but had have provided all the information moving forward not would show accredibility moving forward just get them show january fly here crossed large hurdle get through that process question here chief you know the part their accreditation process they also look how you staff the department absolutely whats the three battalion chiefs the west side and molokai and all that was that part the yes and like taking away those positions would that affect accreditation yes guess the question for then ask the council you guys really want our department accredited not because you then you need staff correctly think thats the question asked mean you gotta put nuts and bolts them right because you say its only gonna cost two hundred thousand more dollars accredited mean what better standard have agree wonder theres way that could send letter` and have the commission chairs signature strongly voicing our opinion the accreditation process and what means finish was wondering how leverage this body into putting pressure the mayor and the chair county council take this seriously you guys might want put that out agenda item for next month and that way its every month that this goes one less month that he's got able just suggestion but would really you're gonna write that letter from this body you may want get more detailed solid information and numbers from the chief rather than some back the envelope calculations you wanted write one your own wouldnt suggest saying its from the body our power collected group its not individuals there was motion put the floor dont see your agenda page youll put the agenda would suggest that for such general purposes what can members can bump our next meeting date and time and can have request have item agendized can discuss the next meeting will work providing you with more hard numbers any more questions members just want say well done this really really really well done and think especially its not costing any money for the taxpayers moving forward this eyes its brainer job well done thank you thank you commissioner lepta any more questions members just one more just complement again what this document does really identifies being former member you know, you think you feel certain ways but here black and white and some color its really good document even for through and and see thank you will this document available public some point will put our website appreciate you bringing that because its really you know theres word thats being tossed around quite often transparency and think going through the accreditation process can not send that message stronger the people than transparency dont even understand how its not supported its extremely important for our community and our visitors know that theyre coming into accredited area and for want that takes lot work from all our members within the department wanting make that happen you know nobody wants somebody come their back yard and tell how for clean their yard but were willing see hey how can make better and goes for everything mean they came and helped with our ocean safety processes well they turned onto more information that realm once into the ninth edition all that has clear well right now they wouldve allowed move forward then have that work progress dont know how much that will cost thats added thing moving the ninth well but thank you very much for the discussion and the support hope that some point time that this can achieved for you well the community thank you for the opportunity all right quick announcement next meeting thursday june the fire prevention bureau the morning have that request add the agenda

nutshell know both you gentlemen have been many commissions before but you have any questions thank your chair yeah dont know whos chair right now but just like know both you guys have been many commissions before you kinda know the drill our chair has arrived relieved thank you vice chair youre time lets move item number six emergency management good morning you have front you our monthly report just few items had received our staff specialist three list and actually were able conduct interviews yesterday and were hoping make offer one the candidates that interviewed for that position well full staff that person takes the position far training and exercises finished our eoc basic training for our partners that was over about five week period where they were coming mondays that and now were moving into hurricane preparedness for community things there was zika tabletop exercise which seems little bit odd because the focus has kind moved away from zika but were getting into the season again where mosquitoes and high travel had that particular exercise the preparedness side our harp program continuing west maui theyve been very successful terms good turnout weve had lot repeat personnel werent sure the people would come each meeting every month but weve seen steady participation that and after this month which tropical cyclone they move away from hazard awareness into actual planning well see how many people start come out for the planning piece which more pencil the paper kind stuff ill just move down the response piece the emergent event guess well call that weve been involved the rat lung worm disease lot times people forget that also are participating with the department health during those types events really were just were not the lead that department health always remains the lead that but continue support terms coordination and especially with their messaging piece you have any questions the report happy take those otherwise ill move into the piece that commissioner john kyle asked about last week last month with the activation levels questions okay you have two handouts front you the first one nice bright color coded one our eoc activation levels used just have three but then fema and the national incident management system had recommended four tier which was very much similar what had just didnt have our day day operations there which level four you can see starts level four normal operations steady state thats today its blue because call blue sky day you know its just nice day were always monitoring for things that might happen with notice event the eoc not staffed that time the number three enhanced steady state something has come that maybe requires pay attention little bit more dont have the eoc staffed really that point but our standby person who call standby throughout the evening hours and off hours monitoring that actively looking notifications from the weather service whatever event might level two partial activation thats the most common thing that have after level three thats when have some our partners maybe event thats focused specific geographic area its not island county wide well have the emergency support functions who would affected that particular event and then level one activation full activation have all our county partners and state and other partners staffing all the emergency support functions anticipation something that know coming its happening occurring are speaking and the response and recoverys going require additional resources than just one two particular agencies the next page just made quick kind glance there are some events that automatically trigger certain activation level and thats what you see that chart there with tropical cyclone when the forecast advisories are issued again see that coming starts out with just our staff and maybe weve made notification for people who have something their day day operations that they would then escalates from watch warning youll see that activation level then scales two and one the one that most ill say difficult maybe difficults not the right word the one thats the most fluid probably flood scenario because flood watch will come out and itll maybe county wide and know theres potential for heavy rains etcetera and then when they issue advisory that means that heavy rains are occurring certain area and flooding may imminent but then when goes warning level its more than just nuisance flooding the advisory what they call nuisance flooding there will flooding and ponding the roads but its not getting into peoples homes its not endangering life much maybe properties but not higher level when warning our staff automatically goes into the eoc because during warning for flood goes from nothing something pretty quickly again weve already been contact with our partners they obviously know its raining outside but were monitoring the situation and just contact with our partners that call when for the standby eoc person call the other partners judgment call ill say and thats the one think that the most fluid far warning doesnt automatically bring the other partners and then things that are notice event like earthquake mass casualty they happen when they happen and then thats automatic eoc activation level charles did that answer your question yes answers lot questions but still have few questions sure now far districts and notification and actions they take lanai molokai lahaina now what point you recommend that they take action measures prepare for storm those are the same what here this island its county wide notification its the other ones like the flood again that its happening strictly specific district those are the ones that are little bit more challenging for but would recommend similar what have here and can talk still havent been able hire our part time person those districts but that person would the one that would staff and activate either themself with partners those eocs okay well guess what looking lets say storm coming and theres certain measures that district supervisors for the public works can take guess whats the trigger point for their activation recommendation from you the public works start preparing those would usually start happening watch level and those the eoc were not were recommending for the departments activate their own plan public works has their own triggers for that and they match with ours when call watch thats why too were always consultation with the weather service when theyre gonna make that call because does trigger actions departmental emergency plans there standard far measures that can taken once they get trigger point for example you know course molokai for example steven arcy used start filling his trucks start staging them critical areas there standard that you know that the public works takes yeah same thing okay both for tsunami and tropical cyclones watch triggers actions each those departments and basically standard plan every district supervisor has their own plan and are others aware that plan its standard plan department wide public works has their plan when into one these levels cant speak their personnel far how well they know their internal plan next question would far the utility companies that are very important whats your dialogue with them far their notifications cause they can take the same precautionary measures too that they you know theres points where water departments theyll shut down you know theyll lock down far dialogue with them where are you when does that happen sure the way have the eoc staffed now our operations section have three branches and one the branches infrastructure and the meco department water supply with the county the telephone company our public and private utilities are part infrastructure branch theyre called and theyre our call list okay they are yup theyre part our all the water departments all the private guys they all come not all the private water guys come they have liaison because dont have that much room when notify them they notify know theres some partnerships like maui yes yes okay they have representative that attends something they have one that represents private water yes thank you youre welcome travis would you interested that part time position know keep your eyes out when comes open had question goes back the rat lung worm disease huh there known hot spot the origin the disease itself here maui general general there place where the rats have the disease and thats why its coming out that area they know not that aware mean here its been weve been seeing obviously east maui but know the big island was linked cow heart and slug there right well that was just that particular incident but theyve had rat lung worm the big island for long time already and think when they started some more research theres been individual instances the other the other counties well but the key for again cause weve seen little bit panic with that particular disease where people are not buying local produce and just want stress that its not that you cannot buy the local produce comes down the consumers the farmers are doing what they can and then the intermediary doing what they can make sure that its clean and safe but consumer its also make sure that were washing and thats all takes washing properly doesnt even take you know those special things that theyre selling the store those sprays and things like that you take the time and wash your produce and its not just should tell folks all produce and thats kind the slogan that were working wash all produce all the time even says pre washed even its from the mainland cause they have other things their produce too sometimes its just habit that need retrain ourselves community wash all produce all the time any more questions thank you ann thank you let now move item number seven fire department aloha good morning members before you you have our monthly highlights for the month april okay does your team need any questions before move forward but any point time through each item you are welcome ask questions all right item the department highlights for motions and interviews you see there have gone through the process going through our recruit trainees did performance agility tests the end march and qualified some people for our openings that have currently have seventeen openings and will starting that class july first this year wanted march excuse may but did not have the funding move forward moves back the average recruit class lasts six and half months that pushes into january two thousand and eighteen our projected retirements are twenty for this year had five thus far anticipate fifteen more that might cause shortage issue going towards the end the year and thats something that try have discussions with council and the mayors office chief yes would you describe little bit more about what you said when you didnt have the funds okay you had delay the training class because you didnt have funds yes our department ran into shortage somewhere around november two thousand and sixteen and move forward move around funding from different programs make project til june came with short fall one point two million moving forward payroll and what have you those areas utilized overtime for our training instructors come and help with the process the recruit class and that was issue and topic and did not have the funding pay for the recruits during this fiscal year thats where the shortages are and have you thought about going back county council asking for special assessment did and sorry for pulling you into this provided the information for them and money was added our budget for this fiscal year handle but there was lengthy discussion about your million and half short roughly and what will that grow the end the fiscal year hopefully not much ask for budget amendment move forward the handle all those payroll issues and had the amendment believe its second reading not mistaken for next week and hopefully get that and nothing drastic happens between now and june but this our fifth year that weve gone for budget amendment let guess the first four didnt get theres question was gonna ask you the first four every year thus far this our fifth year that weve gone for budget amendment every year yeah every year weve gotten budget amendment for the shortage thank you chief youre welcome you said every year you had new budget every year its ranged from eighty thousand dollars two million dollars present our budget those are the things that into the process from the mayors office and then gets cut during the budget deliberations with council lot our projections are pretty close what need but then the cuts are made and have back through this process over and over again curious who you submit the request the chair budget chair yes the process goes through transmittal form which goes from the mayors office budget from budget the chair the council and then from the budget mean from the council chair the budget chair and then theyll either schedule not thank you youre welcome next question here sure chief you know when you have recruitment for classes how advertised online well the maui news and believe the star advertiser but doesnt into the molokai district cant answer that question you cant answer cause thats how molokai people dont know when the recruitments happen yeah that comes out our personal department but can pass that information can get that advertisement too commissioner notifications yeah kind doesnt necessarily through the fire department the department personnel services handles that you can ask for quest but its not something handled internally the department but ill ask cause mean think that would effective way get more molokai people apply because they just dont know about wonder our personnel services has notification list they you just put your name and now they have electronically individual can even theyre not looking for anybody provide their information that list and then when they send the list out the first mail out the newspaper then would come them the following monday usually goes out sunday and monday theyll get email blast long their email address information correct and updated guess you can let the newspapers molokai know that have people just sign thats good idea should pay for itself though man itd sure alleviate the non employment issue based that information that request will send that information department personnel services thank you members like welcome miss cher betas the meeting sorry all right moving from seven item number incident reports can look your handouts for the month april and you have any questions questions just noticed that what you call false alarms stays pretty consistent the amount yeah sure does yeah any questions members just one question about this false alarms are they from alarm companies are they from people actually pulling alarms its mix both believe spoke not sure was last month the month before but anytime have the alarm companies issue and its more than three times send them letter they usually get them pretty quick there anybody youre actually tracking whose constant repeat false alarm goes the car fire and hazard have one that separate ours passed before the police false alarm bill have process that can use after those individuals companies that have false alarms mean anything that you know you can reduce you know this cry wolf syndrome and lot times when get rash this its due bad weather electronically things dont run properly thats when youll see the influx and doesnt just happen but police department civil events and emergency management the big problem noticed when was working was alarms werent being serviced right and the batteries werent being replaced and when there was power outage youre supposed switch that battery thats backed but the batteries dead triggers the alarm think but they really need somebody really needs look ensuring that alarm companies service these alarms regular basis prevent this excessive response false alarms for the most part have excess six thousand commercial properties and all those have fire alarms were talking fifty out those six thousand that know think the ratio really good considering anything excessive reach out through our fire prevention bureau and through our inspection process that the checklist all times looked daily basis throughout our community hopefully that helps thank you youre welcome chief you made question the alarms all these commercial properties like multiples quick malls and all they all have lock boxes you know requirement from they start off new require them the lock box and majority them have that try not use that lesson yeah thats available any more questions okay item fire department two thousand fiscal year two thousand and eighteen budget updates which the three all right out our eighty three items that put forward through the mayors office only four those items made through council and then gonna talk little bit about some the cuts all right you know county wide funding where they try put most the equipment along with department public works and environmental management they put that fund for our ladder truck that cut four hundred thousand dollars from one point two million believe was eight hundred that doesnt get sufficient ladder truck but were the process putting that out bid and see where ends and then maybe going back ask for amendment for the bid that comes the winning bid have question chief sure you know when they make these cuts they consult with you guys experts their decision why theyre making the cuts when you guys know that something that you need smart thank you for that question that really good question the answer know they try research with other departments within hawaii what one the measuring points that they have really consider specifications what are the differences and what are different needs the other counties opposed ours were pretty clear what our needs are and not sure what the whole process about their decisions are but this not the first time that thats happened really puts the damper the whole process and the whole timing the contracts when they actually out thank you for that question the good news the two battalion chiefs that this commission well our administration has been fighting for has been put for limited term what that means were able hire the two people but theyll limited not permanent and the findings audit that they also approved that council will pay for whatever that findings come out will either make those positions permanent eliminate them completely not sure how that process gonna work still waiting the information for that but our department will full cooperation with that audit one the suggestions had was that the accreditation full blown audit the department and that was already paid for non profit which was much less cost wise but the council felt that they wanted something independently that was the decision that was made that they will fund that and well full cooperation with that chief what was the limitations the two positions based the findings the audit there wasnt two year term anything were not sure what the total time frame pending the audit the only thing that asked was that provide and fit the national fire protection agencies associations guidelines they accepted that fashion very comfortable doesnt matter who they hire when you anticipate the audit being complete have idea cause they havent chosen auditor auditor firm yet guess that would just disappointing you hire the two bodies got and the audit finishes six months later and then those bodies are adjusted there that possibility but going into that theyll fine for the fiscal year cause believe you have the funding for one year all positions are only for one year with active budget technically got the positions but dont have the funding for the positions have make adjustments for that well those are the kinds things thank you okay well didnt show our yeah but theyre funded thank you sorry ive just been corrected funded out the current budget yeah the loan the fyet budget which kicks july but they give positions mine okay that was good and thats awesome cause were under the assumption that cause didnt show our spreadsheet sir thank you all right and some the notable items that will need more funding moving forward our helicopter the new contracts came out and was slightly higher course you know the last contract was done four years ago annual cost basis that needs adjusted some point time there was discussion about eliminating our ocean safety battalion chief that got put back there well funding and whole thing was just wanted move from our admin program the ocean safety program could keep all that money and funding and personnel that same program couple minor adjustments were taking out our maintenance program they moved our four mechanics the operations program and still dont understand how and why that happened but the funding was maintained funding maintained which they just moved operations kind interesting process not sure what the whole thoughts were behind that but doesnt really affect and were gonna manage the same just clarification the board any questions all right having none moving forward the maui fire department standards covered accreditation report last month handed out folder that included those two reports and not sure anybody was able through that and may have some questions but what like over the first report which called the standards cover and that information compiled internally our people through dispatch and all our report management system all those data provided for you and this standards cover the data and information shows where need improve this the final report for that and covers every aspect our response and how our emergency areas that cover for all the districts youre gonna see some different response times different areas based the distances and the resources anybody has any questions the standards cover this quite robust document even its not this time you know let the chair know and ill able answer the questions for you lot work about year and half work went into this document and all part the accreditation process have question chief you know for that accreditation the response from the station the scene what the time part the crediting like twelve minutes its all dependent its all dependent for district and what provided the accreditation board for instance any city area its about sixteen minutes twelve sixteen minutes depending and thats for your first and second then like the say like cause theres big gap between paia and hana yes now would that fall under different category because its geographical yes falls under rural timeline and even those dont meet because our roadways and the distance just comment thought this was pretty awesome lot work you can see that lot work went into and you know being former member it's very impressive see all this work documenting that our department does and you know did you put team together put this yes you know for about seven years weve been asking for accreditation manager just one person and all know that that one person wouldnt able compile anything like this any point even they did that for twenty four hours day what did put team together and what call cadre system basically like instructors and what have you but put together team help with this accreditation process put teams for the standard cover put teams for the emergency response areas put teams for all those things some the over time that brought goes into that process did not pay the accreditation board anything other than pay for the travel the individuals coming out cause theyre non profit but they are the experts this area management believe that this process was very effective and efficient and they help provide these kinds documents for you thank your commissioner some time for that now any more questions the standards cover chief one quick question looking your response times again and looking for hana specifically and thirteen was twenty six minutes what page page fifty fifty five zero two thousand and thirteen the fire response was twenty six minutes and fifteen goes forty five minutes whats causing such dramatic change response time for hana okay how that works theyll take average the top ninety percent all responses during that annual year what that says that their distant response halts were further than the one the ninety percent that was done the year before but they still have factored theres way for you know manipulate the data the data what and have take that ninety percent all those calls that becomes your average for that year and glad that you picked that cause those are the things that the accreditation board looks our tour the island they saw the challenges that have and theyve given suggestions their report how manage that have question chief yes was wondering how many audits has this organization done with other fire departments thousands all them all them except for theyre the only body that does this internationally well the united states and only two hundred and forty two departments the united states are accredited out the ten thousand that are exist guess you were just unlucky that someone calls bad feelings call forward well absolutely yes had some calls that have been running five hours its really really interesting yeah when you take them tour then you take them around totally around the island they know that theres station kipahulu its really not its really good that through the data the statistics and really work out because our constituents need understand what are against and then this information helps provide what need budget well right like said our open arms that audit from third party and this was third party but well all over again its not issue for have nothing hide wanna learn more and want able provide that information much possible this information was provided each council member yes all right moving over the next report which the accreditation report this report you look the first page composed and written the four peer assessors that showed maui january and this the report they provided with the breakdown the areas that need work they also touch some the things that very well what page that accreditation report cover page the tab. look for the tab this one this report much more specific the needs and what our department needs work and focus because all the other core competencies were already met one the real issues have deadline for august this year and based our budgeting and what set forward that were not gonna make that deadline were hoping through this process provide the information and have the cadres work all the information that needs assessed and turned and then theyll come out and another assessment and our hopes are pass and accredited officially march but thats not gonna happen cause not have the funding put the teams together work these items were only eight items shy the total most departments through this process anyway the real issue here that invested lot money and time through this process self assessor and that was done the eighth edition starting january two thousand and eighteen all assessments done after that will have done the ninth edition theyll whole another process that have kind get all over again really was trying get this done august this year but its not gonna done when you say eighth edition ninth edition thats how many years that youve been working its the editions that the accreditation body comes out with they see times believe the eighth edition has been out approximately five six years and theyre making changes okay right they provided with window opportunity for three years get done and just were unable were gonna have start from scratch literally the next time through this process least your procedures directing there thats great theres lot positives that whole process right there sounds negative but theres lot positives that was learned through the process and were gonna continue press forward with these equipment right and that was one the areas that failed these our facilities because have real means managing maintenance our facilities where other departments have people that actually they have building maintenance repairs have none have fifteen facilities and have nobody take care them how many areas did you succeed and how many areas did you fail failed eight out out eighty six believe and those eighty six have met theres two hundred and sixty four other ones that met the majority those well but eight the core just did not meet eight out eighty six the chief this yeah thats pretty good the budget thats being worked right now the council for next year chief have question know you provided all the council people with the information here now with budget process sure they read this already couple times who less responsive the reason far council what does that mean whos the less responsive the needs the fire department the budget thats very subjective would recommend you wanted look into personally know would recommend you want look into personally but dont think the chief has opinion that probably have read the minutes that yes read the minutes and make your own conclusions thank you for the question chief just have one major concern the funding that you need complete the accreditation was supported the county administration yes see before started off this process went the classes understood what needed started front load the process with whatever funding had nine years ago and every year thus far and then two years ago had get the mayor sign off and support this has supported the process its just when gets the next level that its not supported youre pretty close know just like the police department you through review process internally where you kick around okay what need you know and then you put together and things get cut internally then goes the mayors office that things being cut but the final problem seems like just get over that hurdle need work little bit better with legislative portion get the funding that need yes thats good question just for clarification purposes accreditation basically audit the department and its whole operations prior that like said front loaded lot things and one the areas that did was our area certification for our needs and training for our department members that are snuff with and just try get the whole department whole all its policies and all its standing orders and standard operating guidelines the same process and hopefully one day we'll get the support needed youre just the feet yes being shiny not very far its extremely frustrating come this far the process and not being able finish feel you chief what dollar value are looking what what would the funding mechanism what would the dollars that you feel you need finish this out well initially would say six out the eight would come into some overtime which would probably about forty thousand dollars okay forty grand what else the other two would come into some processes and software and what have you for our records managing that are not sure what the total cost would but even estimated one hundred thousand dollars one hundred and fifty thousand dollars thats still reach for two hundred thousand dollars youd finish this project would say yes thats estimate yes once the program say you got the funding mutual funding for the program finish you know meeting the eight things that were not meeting right now has there been any discussion with council about should they decide adopt accreditation there big change pay for the department not all theres change pay all its saying that our department has met the standards accreditation which higher than minimum thats all were asking because want able provide the community with the best possible service and third party would say that the maui fire department cuts ratings that was goal this commission when got hired just trying carry what was asked within means chief have follow question were able somehow get the funding finish accreditation the timing still factor that would still huge factor because theres other departments that have work with and wed have have all their support well dont know three months two months would make happen but had the funds would try very hard make happen thats all could promise you there way ask the accreditation board for extension without funding tried that already fact went through that process november ask for extension and they basically said the extension would august september this year but had have provided all the information moving forward not would show accredibility moving forward just get them show january fly here crossed large hurdle get through that process question here chief you know the part their accreditation process they also look how you staff the department absolutely whats the three battalion chiefs the west side and molokai and all that was that part the yes and like taking away those positions would that affect accreditation yes guess the question for then ask the council you guys really want our department accredited not because you then you need staff correctly think thats the question asked mean you gotta put nuts and bolts them right because you say its only gonna cost two hundred thousand more dollars accredited mean what better standard have agree wonder theres way that could send letter` and have the commission chairs signature strongly voicing our opinion the accreditation process and what means finish was wondering how leverage this body into putting pressure the mayor and the chair county council take this seriously you guys might want put that out agenda item for next month and that way its every month that this goes one less month that he's got able just suggestion but would really you're gonna write that letter from this body you may want get more detailed solid information and numbers from the chief rather than some back the envelope calculations you wanted write one your own wouldnt suggest saying its from the body our power collected group its not individuals there was motion put the floor dont see your agenda page youll put the agenda would suggest that for such general purposes what can members can bump our next meeting date and time and can have request have item agendized can discuss the next meeting will work providing you with more hard numbers any more questions members just want say well done this really really really well done and think especially its not costing any money for the taxpayers moving forward this eyes its brainer job well done thank you thank you commissioner lepta any more questions members just one more just complement again what this document does really identifies being former member you know, you think you feel certain ways but here black and white and some color its really good document even for through and and see thank you will this document available public some point will put our website appreciate you bringing that because its really you know theres word thats being tossed around quite often transparency and think going through the accreditation process can not send that message stronger the people than transparency dont even understand how its not supported its extremely important for our community and our visitors know that theyre coming into accredited area and for want that takes lot work from all our members within the department wanting make that happen you know nobody wants somebody come their back yard and tell how for clean their yard but were willing see hey how can make better and goes for everything mean they came and helped with our ocean safety processes well they turned onto more information that realm once into the ninth edition all that has clear well right now they wouldve allowed move forward then have that work progress dont know how much that will cost thats added thing moving the ninth well but thank you very much for the discussion and the support hope that some point time that this can achieved for you well the community thank you for the opportunity all right quick announcement next meeting thursday june the fire prevention bureau the morning have that request add the agenda possible letter support for staff cover accreditation
